rome_sight_0038,catalogue,Ara Pacis,"<p>Constructed under Emperor Augustus, the <strong>Ara Pacis</strong>, or Altar of Peace, is one of the most significant monuments of ancient Rome. It was erected in 9 BC to celebrate the peace and prosperity Augustus had brought to the Roman Empire after his victorious campaigns in Gaul and Spain.</p><p>Commissioned by the Senate, the <strong>Ara Pacis</strong> was positioned so that the shadow of the huge obelisk sundial on Campus Martius would fall upon it on Augustus&rsquo; birthday. Carved along the sides of the altar in Carrara marble are figures in depicting a procession that took place on 4 July 13 BC &ndash; <em>lictors</em> (guards), <em>augurs</em> (soothsayers) and <em>flamines</em> (priests) are followed by Augustus and his family members. The members of the emperor&rsquo;s family can be identified, ranked by their position in the succession. At the time the heir apparent was Marcus Agrippa, husband of Augustus&rsquo;s daughter Julia. All the portraits in the relief are carved with extraordinary realism, even the innocent toddler clinging to his mother&rsquo;s skirts. A scale model of the Ara Pacis with a key helps to identify the characters, while a huge Caesar family tree makes it easier to work out who is related to whom.</p><p>The tale of the rediscovery of the <strong>Ara Pacis</strong> dates back to the 16th century, when the first panels were unearthed. One section ended up in Paris, another in Florence. Further discoveries were made in the late 19th century, when archaeologists finally realized just what they had found. What we see today has all been pieced together since 1938, in part original, in part facsimile. In 1999 the architect Richard Meier designed a building to house the monument, the first modern structure to rise in the centre of Rome in 70 years.</p><p>Visible from the <strong>Ara Pacis</strong> is an overgrown brick cylinder that is actually the Mausoleum of Augustus, where the emperor and his family were buried. The mausoleum is currently undergoing restoration and there are plans to re-open it &ndash; exactly 2,000 years after Augustus died in AD 14 &ndash; as part of a pedestrianized Tridente zone.</p>",,Lungotevere in Augusta,Rome,00186,Piazza di Spagna & Trevi Fountain,,Italy,,06 0608,,,,,,,,,www.arapacis.it,,,,"70, 81, 117, 119, 186, 224, 590, 628, 913, 913F, 913FL, 926, C3",9am–7pm Tue–Sun,,Mon,TRUE,,,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"Audioguides (€3.50) available from the ticket desk in Italian, English, French & Spanish",€30–40; EU under 18s €5.50; under 6s free |,,5.50,0,"EU under 25s and over 65 €5.50, under 6s free",EUR,41.905818,12.475222,TRUE,,FALSE,Historic Sights and Landmarks,Historic Sights and Landmarks,,,,,TRUE,ara_pacis_rome_dk_AL545420,Ara Pacis (Altar of Peace),&#169;dkimages,AL545420,,,,,ara_pacis_rome_dk_AL54

However, there is nothing Christian about the arch &ndash; in fact, it is mostly a pastiche of pagan elements taken from several earlier monuments. The beautiful hunt-scene roundels come from a temple dedicated to Emperor Hadrian&rsquo;s male lover, Antinous, and there are statues of Dacian prisoners taken from Trajan&rsquo;s Forum and reliefs of Marcus Aurelius, including one where he distributes bread to the poor.

Aurelian ordered the wall&rsquo;s construction as a defence against Germanic tribes, whose raids were penetrating deeper and deeper into Italy. Some 18 km (11 miles) round, with 18 gates and 381 towers, the wall took in all the seven hills of Rome. Maxentius (AD 306&ndash;12) then raised the wall to almost twice its original height, making it near impassable. It acted as Rome&rsquo;s main defence until 1870, when it was breached by Italian artillery just by Porta Pia, close to today&rsquo;s British Embassy.</p><p>Out of its 18 gates, many are still in use. Porta San Sebastiano is the largest and the best-preserved gateway in the Aurelian Wall, having been rebuilt by Emperor Honorius in the 5th century AD. Originally the Porta Appia, after the Via Appia Antica it leads to, in Christian times it gradually became known as the Porta San Sebastiano, because the Via Appia led to the Basilica and Catacombs of San Sebastiano, which were popular places of pilgrimage. It was at Porta San Sebastiano that the last triumphal procession to enter the city by the Appian Way was received in state &ndash; that of Marcantonio Colonna after the victory of Lepanto over the Turkish fleet in 1571.</p><p>Today the gate&rsquo;s towers house a museum with prints and models showing the walls&rsquo; history.

Completed by Emperor Caracalla in AD 217, the baths functioned for about 300 years, until the plumbing was destroyed by invading Goths. Over 1,600 bathers at a time could enjoy these luxurious <em>thermae </em>free of charge.</p><p>&nbsp;A Roman bath was a serious business, beginning with a sort of Turkish bath, followed by a spell in the <em>caldarium</em>, a large hot room with pools of water to provide humidity. Then came the lukewarm <em>tepidarium</em>, a visit to the large central meeting place, known as the <em>frigidarium</em>, and finally a plunge into the <em>natatio</em>, an open-air Olympic-sized swimming pool. For the rich, this was followed by a rub-down with scented woollen cloth.</p><p>&nbsp;Surrounded by grass and umbrella pines, and not very crowded, the Baths of Caracalla is one of the most enjoyable ancient sites in the city. The marked route through the baths has lively information boards in English and Italian and takes visitors first to the <em>apodyterium</em> (dressing room), which has remains of mosaic pavements, and then to the huge <em>frigidarium</em>. The two granite bathtubs on Piazza Farnese were once here, with water cascading out of them into what was the <em>natatio.</em> Beyond this is evidence that part of the baths was originally on two levels &ndash; there is a stairway leading to nowhere, and fragments of the upper storey&rsquo;s mosaic pavements decorated with tritons, dolphins, cupids and marine monsters can be seen in the grass.</p><p>&nbsp;Although there are remnants of mosaics dotted throughout the site, most of the rich marble decorations of the baths were removed by the Farnese family in the 16th century to adorn the interior of Palazzo Farnese. The family&rsquo;s ancient sculpture collection was also found here, including Hercules, a signed Greek original.</p><p>&nbsp;The archaeological complex used to be the venue for Rome&rsquo;s most important opera festival. Open-air operas are no longer staged here however, because the vocal exertions of the performers are now thought to pose a threat to the structure of this ancient monument.</p>","EWTG_ROME197BATCAR, TT_ROME040ANCSIG_008_R12, TT_ROME118ANCROM_005, EWFG_ROME230BATCAR",Via delle Terme di Caracalla 52,Rome,00100 ,Ancient Rome,,Italy,,06 3996 7700,,,,,,,,,www.archeoroma.beniculturali.it,,Circo Massimo,,"118, 160, 628","9am–2pm Mon, 9am–1hr before sunset Tue–Sun",,"1 Jan, 25 Dec",TRUE,,,TRUE,TRUE,,,Admission charge,,,,,EUR,41.8791903269993,12.4952128529548,FALSE,,FALSE,Ancient Ruins,"Ancient Ruins, Historic Sights and Landmarks",,,,,TRUE,baths_of_caracalla_rome_dk_AL230382,Mosaic fragment at the Baths of Caracalla,&#169;dkimages,AL230382,,,,,baths_of_caracalla_rome_dk_AL23

These catacombs contain the oldest known image of the Madonna and Child, a fresco thought to date back to the late 1st or early 2nd century AD.

The park has a playground with swings, rope-climbing frames, climbing arcs and see-saws, pony rides and a small roller-skating and cycling rink.

In fact, the impression of the work is more like that of the 4th-century Arch of Constantine than Trajan&rsquo;s monument. Gone are the heroic qualities of the Roman soldiers, by now mostly barbarian mercenaries, and a sense of respect for the vanquished. A new emphasis on the supernatural points to the end of the Hellenistic tradition and the beginning of Christianity.</p><p>The column was restored in 1588 by Domenico Fontana on the orders of Pope Sixtus V. The statue of Marcus Aurelius and his wife on the monument&rsquo;s summit was replaced by a bronze of St Paul.</p><p>The Column of Marcus Aurelius is 3.7 m (12 ft) in diameter and has an internal spiral staircase that leads to the top.

rome_sight_0214,catalogue,Domus Aurea,"<p>After allegedly setting fire to Rome in AD 64, Nero built himself an outrageous new palace. The <strong>Domus Aurea</strong> (sometimes called Nero&rsquo;s Golden House) occupied part of the Palatine and most of the Celian and Esquiline hills &ndash; an area approximately 25 times the size of the Colosseum. &nbsp;</p><p>According to ancient Roman literature, the Domus Aurea&rsquo;s landscaped grounds had a huge artificial lake, complete with real ships and fake seaside villages, bath complexes, gardens, zoos, woods, grottos and elegant porticoes. The palace walls were allegedly adorned with gold and mother-of-pearl, rooms were designed with ceilings that showered guests with flowers or perfumes, the dining hall rotated and the baths were fed with both sulphurous water and sea water. As Nero killed himself in AD 68, he did not have long to enjoy his new home.</p><p>Nero&rsquo;s successors, anxious to distance themselves from the monster-emperor, did their utmost to erase all traces of the palace. Vespasian drained the lake and built the Colosseum in its place, Titus and Trajan each erected a complex of baths over the palace, and Hadrian placed the Temple of Venus and Rome over the vestibule.</p><p>Rooms from one wing of the palace have survived, buried beneath the ruins of the Baths of Trajan on the Oppian hill. Excavations have revealed large frescoes and mosaics which are thought to be a panorama of Rome from a bird&rsquo;s-eye perspective.

rome_sight_0260,catalogue,Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi,"Built for Pope Innocent X Pamphilj, this magnificent fountain in the centre of Piazza Navona was unveiled in 1651. The pope’s coat of arms, the dove and the olive branch decorate the pyramid rock formation supporting the Roman obelisk, which once stood in the Circus of Maxentius on the Appian Way. Bernini designed the fountain, which was paid for by means of taxes on bread and other staples. The great rivers – the Ganges, the Danube, the Nile and the River Plate – are represented by four giants. The Nile’s veiled head symbolizes the river’s unknown source, but there is also a legend that the veil conveys Bernini’s dislike for the nearby Sant’Agnese in Agone, designed by his rival Borromini. Similarly, the athletic figure of the River Plate, cringing with arm upraised, is supposed to express Bernini’s fear that the church will collapse. Sadly, these widely believed stories can have no basis in fact: Bernini had completed the fountain before Borromini started work on the church. |",EWTG_ROME120FONDEI,Piazza Navona,Rome,00186,Piazza Navona & Campo de’ Fiori,,Italy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"30, 46, 62, 64, 70, 81, 87, 116, 116T, 130F, 186, 492, 628, C3, N7",,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,EUR,41.8989680853218,12.4733486785736,FALSE,,FALSE,Fountains and Obelisks,Fountains and Obelisks,Monuments and Tombs | PIAZZA NAVONA |,,,,TRUE,fontana_dei_quattro_fiumi_rome_dk_AL591876,"Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi, Piazza Navona",&#169;dkimages,AL591876,,,,,fontana_dei_quattro_fiumi_rome_dk_AL59

rome_sight_0276,catalogue,Fori Imperiali,"As Rome became an international power and the city expanded, the original Forum became too small, and emperors began to build new fora – the Fori Imperiali. Building a new forum was also a very good way for an emperor to demonstrate his importance to the populace and the world. All had temples, were surrounded by walls, were symmetrical and all but one were built to celebrate a victory. | Caesar built his Forum, complete with heated public toilet, to celebrate his conquest over Gaul. He spent a fortune buying up and demolishing houses on the site he had selected, and dedicated a temple to Venus, with statues of himself and Cleopatra inside. Augustus’ Forum celebrated his victory over Caesar’s assassins, Brutus and Cassius, and the temple at its centre was dedicated to Mars the Avenger, whose statue looked suspiciously like Augustus. Domitian’s Forum, of which little remains, celebrated his capture of Jerusalem while Nerva’s was the smallest – little more than a corridor leading to a temple dedicated to the goddess Minerva. | The Forum of Trajan – built after the emperor’s victory over the Dacians – was probably the most ambitious. An entire slice of the Quirinal Hill was dug away to make room for it. Dominated by Trajan’s Column, it included two libraries and was overlooked by Trajan’s Markets.

Jews were much appreciated for their financial and medical skills during the time of the Roman Empire. Systematic persecution began in the 16th century. From 25 July 1556 all Rome’s Jews were forced to live inside a high-walled enclosure erected on the orders of Pope Paul IV. The Ghetto was in an unhealthy part of Rome. Inhabitants were only allowed out during the day, and on Sundays they were driven into the Church of Sant’Angelo in Pescheria to listen to Christian sermons – a practice abolished only in 1848. Persecution started again in 1943 with the German occupation. Although many Jews were helped to escape or hidden by Roman citizens, thousands were deported to German concentration camps. Today many Jews still live in the former Ghetto and the medieval streets retain much of their old character. The Synagogue on Lungotevere was completed in 1904 and houses a Jewish museum that describes the history of the community through plans, Torahs and other artifacts. |",EWTG_ROME152GHESYN_001,Lungotevere Dè Cenci,Rome,00186,Piazza Navona & Campo de’ Fiori,,Italy,,06 6840 0661,,,,,,,,,www.romaebraica.it,,,Arenula/cairoli,"23, 63, 280, 780","<p>mid-Jun–mid-Sep: 10am–7pm Sun–Thu, 10am–4pm Fri</p><p>mid-Sep–mid-Jun: 10am–5pm Sun–Thu, 9am–2pm Fri</p>",,Sat & Jewish hols,,,,TRUE,TRUE,,,Admission charge,,,,,EUR,41.891879,12.4777,TRUE,,FALSE,,Religious Buildings,CAMPO DE’ FIORI |,,,"transport - tram: 8. | no_photography | additional_info: Ghetto, main street is Via del Portico d’Ottavia. |",TRUE,ghetto_and_synagogue_lungotevere_dei_cenci_rome_dk_AL545630,Jewish Ghetto and Synagogue,&#169;dkimages,AL545630,,,,,ghetto_and_synagogue_lungotevere_dei_cenci_rome_dk_AL54

In the dream, an angel showed him the bodies of Rome’s unwanted babies dredged up from the River Tiber in fishing nets. As a result, the pope hastened to build a hospice for sick paupers. In 1475 the hospital was reorganized by Pope Sixtus IV to care for the poor pilgrims expected for the Holy Year. Sixtus’s hospital was a radical building. Cloisters divided the different types of patients; one area is still reserved for orphans and their nurses. Unwanted infants were passed through a revolving barrel-like contraption called the rota, still visible to the left of the central entrance in Borgo Santo Spirito, to guarantee anonymity. Martin Luther, who visited in 1511, was shocked by the number of abandoned children he saw, believing them to be “the sons of the pope himself”. In the centre, under the hospital’s conspicuous drum, is an octagonal chapel, where mass was said for patients. This room can be visited while the rest of the building still functions as a hospital. |",EWTG_ROME226HOSSAN,Borgo Santo Spirito 2,Rome,00193,The Vatican,,Italy,,06 6821 0854,,,,,,,,,,,,,"23, 34, 40, 46, 62, 64, 98, 115, 116, 271, 280, 571, 870",10am & 3.30pm Mon,,,,,,,TRUE,,,Admission charge,,,,,EUR,41.900912,12.462089,TRUE,,FALSE,,"Religious Buildings, Historic Sights and Landmarks",VATICAN |,,,,TRUE,hospital_of_santo_spirito_rome_dk_AL544936,Fresco at the Hospital of Santo Spirito,&#169;dkimages,AL544936,,,,,hospital_of_santo_spirito_rome_dk_AL54

rome_sight_0479,catalogue,Mausoleum of Augustus,"Now just a weedy mound ringed with cypresses and sadly strewn with litter, this was once the most pres-tigious burial place in Rome. Augustus had the mausoleum built in 28 BC, the year he became sole ruler, as a tomb for himself and his descendants. The circular building was 87 m (285 ft) in diameter with two obelisks (now in Piazza del Quirinale and Piazza dell’Esquilino) at the entrance. Inside were four concentric passageways linked by corridors where the urns containing the ashes of the Imperial family were placed. The first to be buried here was Augustus’s favourite nephew, Marcellus, who had married Julia, the emperor’s daughter. He died in 23 BC, possibly poisoned by Augustus’s second wife Livia, who felt that her son, Tiberius, would make a more reliable emperor. When Augustus died in AD 14, his ashes were placed in the mausoleum, Tiberius duly became emperor, and dynastic poisonings continued to fill the family vault with urns. This sinister monument was later used as a medieval fortress, a vineyard, a private garden, and even, in the 18th century, as an auditorium and theatre. |",EWTG_ROME141MAUAUG,Piazza Augusto Imperatore,Rome,00186,Piazza di Spagna & Trevi Fountain,,Italy,,06 0608,,,,,,,,,,,Spagna,,"81, 117, 492, 628, 926",By appointment only,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,EUR,41.905926,12.476412,TRUE,,FALSE,,Ancient Ruins,PIAZZA DI SPAGNA |,,,,TRUE,mausoleum_of_augustus_rome_getty_162104322,Mausoleum of Augustus,&#169;Getty Images/P.

rome_sight_0496,catalogue,Moses Fountain,"Officially known as the Fontana dell’Acqua Felice, this fountain owes its popular name to the grotesque statue of Moses in the central niche. The massive structure with its three elegant arches was designed by Domenico Fontana to mark the terminal of the Acqua Felice aqueduct, so called because it was one of the many great improvements commissioned by Felice Peretti, Pope Sixtus V. Completed in 1587, it brought clean piped water to this quarter of Rome for the first time. The notorious statue of Moses striking water from the rock is larger than life and the proportions of the body are obviously wrong. Sculpted either by Prospero Bresciano or Leonardo Sormani, it is a clumsy attempt at recreating the awesome appearance of Michelangelo’s Moses in the church of San Pietro in Vincoli (see San Pietro in Vincoli). As soon as it was unveiled, it was said to be frowning at having been brought into the world by such an inept sculptor. The side reliefs also illustrate water stories from the Old Testament: Aaron leading the Israelites to water and Joshua pointing the army towards the Red Sea. The fountain’s four lions are copies of Egyptian originals (now in the Vatican Museums), which Sixtus V had put there for the public’s “convenience” and “delight”. |",EWTG_ROME162MOSFOU,Via XX Settembre,Rome,00187,Ancient Rome,,Italy,,,,,,,,,,,,,Repubblica,,"36, 60, 61, 62, 84, 175, 492",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,EUR,41.904228,12.494137,FALSE,,FALSE,,Fountains and Obelisks,Monuments and Tombs | QUIRINAL |,,,"location: Fontana dell’Acqua Felice, Piazza San Bernardo. |",TRUE,moses_fountain_rome_superstock_1566_252439_1_reformat,"Moses Fountain, Piazza San Bernardo",&#169;Superstock/age fotostock/Fabrizio Troiani,1566-1252439,SuperStock,Fabrizio Troiani,,,moses_fountain_rome_superstock_1566_252439_1_refo
rome_sight_0498,catalogue,Musei di Villa Torlonia,"A large park with several villas, Villa Torlonia was created in the 19th century for a wealthy banker, Prince Giovanni Torlonia. It sprang to fame in the 1920s, when Torlonia’s nephew rented it out, for the tiny sum of one lira per year, to Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. The villa remained Mussolini’s main residence until 1943, when he was ousted from power. The grounds were then turned into a public park, but the buildings fell into disrepair. It was only in the 1990s that it was decided to restore them. The grounds now house several minor musems, as well as Rome’s innovative science space, Technotown. | To find out more about the life of the Mussolini family, visit the Casino Nobile, where exhibits include the bed in which Mussolini slept and the anti-air-raid and anti-gas bunkers that he constructed, as well as old film footage on the villa and Mussolini’s residence. The interiors reflect 19th-century taste – a pick-and-mix of styles ranging from mock-Etruscan to mock-Gothic, with a mock-Egyptian room complete with hieroglyphic decorations. | It is a lovely walk through the grounds to the diminutive Casina delle Civette, literally “little house of owls”, which looks like a fairy-tale gingerbread house and was designed as a retreat to which the Torlonia family could escape to avoid their formal lives in the main villa. It was almost destroyed by vandalism, fire and the Allied troops who occupied it after the fall of Mussolini.

In 10 BC the Emperor Augustus laid out an enormous sundial in the Campus Martius. Its centre was roughly in today’s Piazza di San Lorenzo in Lucina. The shadow was cast by a huge granite obelisk that he had brought back from Heliopolis in Egypt. Unfortunately this sundial too became inaccurate after only 50 years, possibly due to subsidence. The obelisk was still in the piazza in the 9th century, but then disappeared until it was rediscovered lying under medieval houses in the reign of Pope Julius II (1503–13). The pope was intrigued, because Egyptian hieroglyphs were thought to hold the key to the wisdom of Adam before the Fall, but it was only under Pope Benedict XIV (reigned 1740–58) that the obelisk was finally unearthed. It was erected in its present location in 1792 by Pope Pius VI. |",EWTG_ROME113OBEMON,Piazza di Montecitorio,Rome,00186,Piazza Navona & Campo de’ Fiori,,Italy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"81, 117, 119, 628, N6, N25",,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,EUR,41.9008067155129,12.4787449092273,FALSE,,FALSE,,Fountains and Obelisks,Monuments and Tombs | PIAZZA DELLA ROTONDA |,,,location: Piazza di Montecitorio. |,TRUE,obelisk_of_montecitorio_rome_dk_AL545098,Obelisk of Montecitorio,&#169;dkimages,AL545098,,,,,obelisk_of_montecitorio_rome_dk_AL54

(The elephant was actually sculpted by Ercole Ferrata to Bernini’s design.) When the ancient obelisk was found in the garden of the monastery of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, the friars wanted the monument erected in their piazza. The elephant was provided with its enormous saddle-cloth because of a friar’s insistence that the gap under the animal’s abdomen would undermine its stability. Bernini knew better: you need only look at the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi (see Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi) to appreciate his use of empty space.

Filippo Neri came to Rome aged 18 to work as a tutor. The city was undergoing a period of religious strife and an economic slump after the Sack of Rome in 1527. There was also an outbreak of the plague. It was left to newcomers like Neri and Ignazio di Loyola to revive the spiritual life of the city. Neri formed a brotherhood of laymen who worshipped together and helped pilgrims and the sick (see Santissima Trinità dei Pellegrini Santissima Trinità dei Pellegrini). He founded the Oratory as a centre for religious discourse.

This outstanding collection includes paintings by Rubens, Van Dyck, Murillo, Caravaggio and Guido Reni, together with 17th- and 18th-century Italian regional art. The palazzo is also home to the Accademia dei Lincei, a learned society founded in 1603, which once included Galileo among its members. In 1797 Palazzo Corsini was the backdrop to momentous events: French General Duphot (the fianc&eacute; of Napoleon&rsquo;s sister Pauline) was killed here in a skirmish between papal troops and Republicans. The consequent French occupation of the city and the deportation of Pope Pius VI led to the proclamation of a short-lived Roman Republic (1798&ndash;9).</p>",EWTG_ROME218PALCOR,Via della Lungara 10,Rome,00165,Trastevere & Janiculum Hill,,Italy,,06 680 2323,,,,,,,,,galleriacorsini.beniculturali.it,,,,"23, 280",8:30am–7:30pm Tue–Sun,,"1 Jan, 25 Dec",TRUE,,,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,,,EUR,41.8933287633333,12.46693048,TRUE,,FALSE,,"Historic Sights and Landmarks, Art Galleries and Museums",,,,,TRUE,palazzo_corsini_rome_dk_AL230388,Palazzo Corsini,&#169;dkimages,AL230388,,,,,palazzo_corsini_rome_dk_AL23

Upstairs there are statues from Nero&rsquo;s summer villa in Anzio and Roman copies of famous Greek originals, such as the <em>Discobolos Ex-Lancellotti</em>. The real joy of the museum, however, is on the second floor, where entire rooms of wall paintings have been brought from various villas excavated in and around Rome; a guided tour can be arranged at the museum entrance. The most incredible frescoes are from Livia&rsquo;s Villa at Prima Porta.

Castellesi was finally stripped of his cardinalate by Pope Leo X Medici and disappeared from history. Since then, the palazzo has had many owners and tenants. In the 17th century it was rented for a time by Queen Christina of Sweden.

Mosaic floors, marble pavements and walls have been restored to their former glory, while sound effects re-create an earthquake that buckled the floors in AD 38. During the Renaissance, the area was used as a <em>butto</em> (rubbish dump). This too has been reconstructed in the museum. A sheep&rsquo;s horn, oyster shells, chicken bones, clam and tortoise shells found here give useful clues about the diet of Renaissance Romans.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, public executions were held in <strong>Piazza del Popolo</strong>, often as part of the celebration of Carnival. Condemned men were sometimes hammered to death by repeated blows to the temples. The riderless horse races from the piazza down Via del Corso were scarcely more humane: the performance of the runners was enhanced by feeding the horses stimulants, wrapping them in nail-studded ropes, and letting off fireworks at their heels.</p>","EWTG_ROME137PIADEL, TT_ROME046SQUFOU_004, TT_ROME108SPASTE_007_R12, EWFG_ROME150PIADEL",Piazza del Popolo,Rome,00187,Piazza di Spagna & Trevi Fountain,,Italy,,,,,,,,,,,,,Flaminio,,"95, 117, 119, 490, 495, 926",,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,EUR,41.9105986907583,12.4760477989912,FALSE,,FALSE,Fountains and Obelisks,"Fountains and Obelisks, Historic Sights and Landmarks",,,,,TRUE,piazza_del_popolo_rome_dk_AL229370,Piazza del Popolo,&#169;dkimages,AL229370,,,,,piazza_del_popolo_rome_dk_AL22

It was designed either by the famous Gian Lorenzo Bernini or by his father Pietro. Because the pressure from the aqueduct that feeds the fountain is extremely low there are no spectacular cascades or spurts of water. Instead, Bernini constructed a leaking boat &ndash; <em>barcaccia</em> means useless, old boat &ndash; which lies half submerged in a shallow pool.

In the large slabs of basalt – a hard volcanic rock used in all old Roman roads – note the great ruts created by generations of cartwheels. On top of the arches separate conduits carried the water of two aqueducts: the Aqua Claudia, and its offshoot, the Aqueduct of Nero. They bear inscriptions from the time of the Emperor Claudius and also from the reigns of Vespasian and Titus, who restored them in AD 71 and AD 81 respectively. In all, six aqueducts from different water sources entered the city at Porta Maggiore. The Aqua Claudia was 68 km (43 miles) long, with over 15 km (9 miles) above ground. Its majestic arches are a notable feature of the Roman countryside, and a popular mineral water bears its name. One stretch of the Aqua Claudia had its arches bricked up when it was incorporated into the 3rd-century Aurelian Wall (see Aurelian Wall and Porta San Sebastiano). |",EWTG_ROME184PORMAG,Piazza di Porta Maggiore,Rome,00185,Ancient Rome,,Italy,,,,,,,,,,,,Porta Maggiore,Manzoni,Piazza Di Porta Maggiore,105,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,EUR,41.8918781428698,12.5146823195879,FALSE,,FALSE,,"Ancient Ruins, Historic Sights and Landmarks",Monuments and Tombs | LATERAN |,,,"transport - tram: 3, 5, 14, 19. |",TRUE,porta_maggiore_rome_dk_AL543743,Porta Maggiore,&#169;dkimages,AL543743,,,,,porta_maggiore_rome_dk_AL54

The walls measure 3 km (2 miles) in circumference. Work on the walls started in AD 846. Pope Leo supervised the huge army of labourers personally, and thanks to his encouragement, the job was completed in 4 years. He then consecrated his massive feat of construction. Since the time of Pope Leo the walls have needed much reinforcement and repair. The gateway visible today at Porta Santo Spirito was built by the architect Antonio da Sangallo the Younger in 1543–4. It is framed by two huge bastions that were added in 1564 by Pope Pius IV Medici.

This 2nd-century AD tenement block, of barrel-vault construction, is the only survivor in Rome from that era. The fourth, fifth and part of the sixth storey remain above current ground level. In the Middle Ages, a section of these upper storeys was converted into a church; its bell tower and 14th-century Madonna in a niche are visible from the street. During the Fascist years, the area was cleared, and three lower floors emerged. Some 380 people may have lived in the tenement, in the squalid conditions described by the 1st-century AD satirical writers Martial and Juvenal. The latter mentions that he had to climb 200 steps to reach his garret. This insula may once have had more storeys.

The principal architect was Antonio da Sangallo the Younger, but many others contributed before Carlo Maderno’s elongated cupola was finally completed in 1620. The present façade was added in the 18th century. The church was decorated mainly by Tuscan artists. One interesting exception is the 15th-century statue of San Giovannino by the Sicilian Mino del Reame in a niche above the sacristy. The spectacular high altar houses a marble group by Antonio Raggi, the Baptism of Christ. The altar itself is by Borromini, who is buried in the church along with Carlo Maderno.

Veined jasper and precious multicoloured marbles are sculpted to imitate flowery damask and velvet hangings. Even the altar rail is a long swag of jasper drapery held up by a pair of kneeling angels with wooden wings. Although there are memorials to former members of the Spada family, oddly there is no indication as to which of the Spadas was responsible for endowing the chapel. It was probably art-lover Virgilio Spada, a follower of San Filippo Neri. |",EWTG_ROME148SANGIR,Via di Monserrato 62A,Rome,00186,Piazza Navona & Campo de’ Fiori,,Italy,,06 687 9786,,,,,,,,,www.chiesasangirolamo.org,,,,"23, 40, 46, 62, 64, 116, 280",10:30am–12:30pm Sun & public hols,,Mon–Sat,,,,,,,,,,,,,EUR,41.895313,12.470359,TRUE,,FALSE,,Religious Buildings,CAMPO DE’ FIORI |,,,church_services |,TRUE,san_girolamo_della_carita_rome_dk_AL545523,"Interior, San Girolamo della Carità",&#169;dkimages,AL545523,,,,,san_girolamo_della_carita_rome_dk_AL54
rome_sight_0842,catalogue,San Gregorio Magno,"To the English, this is one of the most important churches in Rome, for it was from here that St Augustine was sent on his mission to convert England to Christianity. The church was founded in AD 575 by San Gregorio Magno (St Gregory the Great), who turned his family home on this site into a monastery. It was rebuilt in medieval times and restored in 1629–33 by Giovanni Battista Soria. The church is reached via a flight of steps from the street. The forecourt contains some interesting tombs. To the left is that of Sir Edward Carne, who came to Rome several times between 1529 and 1533 as King Henry VIII’s envoy to gain the pope’s consent to the annulment of Henry’s marriage to Catherine of Aragon. The interior, remodelled by Francesco Ferrari in the mid-18th century, is Baroque, apart from the fine mosaic floor and some ancient columns. At the end of the right aisle is the chapel of St Gregory. Leading off it, another small chapel, believed to have been the saint’s own cell, houses his episcopal throne – a Roman chair of sculpted marble. The Salviati Chapel on the left contains a picture of the Virgin said to have spoken to St Gregory. Outside, amid the cypresses to the left of the church, stand three small chapels, dedicated to St Andrew, St Barbara and St Sylvia (Gregory the Great’s mother). The chapels contain frescoes by Domenichino and Guido Reni. |",EWTG_ROME192SANGRE,Piazza di San Gregorio,Rome,00184,Ancient Rome,,Italy,,06 700 8227,,,,,,,,,www.camaldolesiromani.it,,Circo Massimo,Parco Celio,"75, 81, 117, 175, 673",Winter: 9am–noon & 3–8pm daily; Summer: 9am–1pm & 3–7:30pm daily,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,EUR,41.885522,12.490574,TRUE,,FALSE,,Religious Buildings,CARACALLA |,,,transport - tram: 3. | church_services |,TRUE,san_gregorio_magno_rome_dk_AL544468,"Marble throne of Gregory the Great, San Gregorio Magno",&#169;dkimages,AL544468,,,,,san_gregorio_magno_rome_dk_AL54

Roasted slowly to death in AD 258, San Lorenzo was one of the most revered of Rome’s early Christian martyrs. The first basilica erected over his burial place by Constantine was largely rebuilt in 576 by Pope Pelagius II. Close by stood a 5th-century church dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The intriguing two-level church we see today is the result of these two churches being knocked into one. This process, started in the 8th century, was completed in the 13th century by Pope Honorius III, when the nave, the portico and much of the decoration were added. The remains of San Lorenzo are in the choir of the 6th-century church (beneath the 13th-century high altar). |",EWTG_ROME265SANLOR,Piazzale del Verano 3,Rome,00185,Ancient Rome,,Italy,,06 446 6184,,,,,,,,,www.basilicasanlorenzo.it,,Policlinico,Verano,"71, 492",7:30am–noon & 4pm–7pm daily,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,EUR,41.9024570478151,12.5202555423278,TRUE,,FALSE,,Religious Buildings,"Churches, Temples and Shrines | Children’s Rome | FURTHER AFIELD |",,,"transport - tram: 3, 19. |",TRUE,san_lorenzo_fuori_le_mura_rome_dk_AL230385,San Lorenzo fuori le Mura,&#169;dkimages,AL230385,,,,,san_lorenzo_fuori_le_mura_rome_dk_AL23

A later Romanesque building burned down in 1519, and was rebuilt by Jacopo Sansovino with a single nave and many richly decorated private chapels on either side. The imposing travertine façade was designed by Fontana in late Baroque style. The third chapel on the right has fine frescoes of the Virgin Mary by Francesco Salviati. The decoration of the next chapel was interrupted by the Sack of Rome in 1527. Raphael’s follower Perin del Vaga fled, leaving the ceiling frescoes to be completed by Daniele da Volterra and Pellegrino Tibaldi when peace returned to the city. In the nave stands a splendid Venetian-style double tomb by Sansovino, a memorial to Cardinal Giovanni Michiel (victim of a Borgia poisoning in 1503) and his nephew, Bishop Antonio Orso. |",EWTG_ROME159SANMAR,Piazza di San Marcello 5,Rome,00187,Piazza di Spagna & Trevi Fountain,,Italy,,06 6993 0221,,,,,,,,,www.sanmarcelloalcorso.it,,,,"62, 63, 81, 85, 95, 117, 119, 160, 175, 492, 628",7am–noon & 4–7pm daily,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,EUR,41.898582,12.481954,TRUE,,FALSE,,Religious Buildings,QUIRINAL |,,,church_services |,TRUE,san_marcello_al_corso_rome_dk_AL545738,"Interior, San Marcello al Corso",&#169;dkimages,AL545738,,,,,san_marcello_al_corso_rome_dk_AL54

The church was restored by Pope Gregory IV in the 9th century – the magnificent apse mosaics date from this period. Further major rebuilding took place in 1455–71, when Pope Paul II Barbo made San Marco the church of the Venetian community in Rome. The blue and gold coffered ceiling is decorated with Pope Paul’s heraldic crest, the lion rampant, recalling the lion of St Mark, the patron saint of Venice. The appearance of the rest of the interior, with its colonnades of Sicilian jasper, was largely the creation of Filippo Barigioni in the 1740s. Complemented by an interesting array of funerary monuments in the aisles, the style is typical of the late Roman Baroque. Leon Battista Alberti, whose name is also mentioned tentatively in connection with Palazzo Venezia, may have been the architect of the elegant travertine arcade and loggia of the façade. |",EWTG_ROME075SANMAR,Piazza San Marco 48,Rome,00186,Piazza Navona & Campo de’ Fiori,,Italy,,06 679 5205,,,,,,,,,www.sanmarcoevangelista.it,,,,"53, 60, 80, 80B, 81, 83, 85, 117, 160, 160F, 170, 175, 271, 628, H",8.30am–noon & 4pm–6pm (Aug: 4–8pm) Tue–Sat (festivals: 9am–1pm & 4–8pm),,"Mon, Sun",,,,,,,,,,,,,EUR,41.895837,12.481761,TRUE,,FALSE,,Religious Buildings,CAPITOL |,,,xref: GETTING THERE | church_services |,TRUE,san_marco_rome_dk_AL544634,"Gilded fresco, San Marco",&#169;dkimages,AL544634,,,,,san_marco_rome_dk_AL54

rome_sight_0857,catalogue,San Martino ai Monti,"Christians have been worshipping on the site of this church since the 3rd century, when they used to meet in the house of a man named Equitius. In the 4th century, after Constantine had legalized Christianity, Pope Sylvester I built a church, one of very few things he did during his pontificate. In fact he was so insignificant that in the 5th century a more exciting life was fabricated for him – which included tales of him converting Constantine, curing him of leprosy and forcing him to close all pagan temples. Pope Sylvester’s fictional life was further enhanced in the 8th century, with the forgery of a document in which Constantine offered him the Imperial crown. Pope Sylvester’s church was replaced in about AD 500 by St Symmachus, rebuilt in the 9th century and then transformed completely in the 1630s. The only immediate signs of its age are the ancient Corinthian columns dividing the nave and aisles. The most interesting interior features are a series of frescoed landscapes of the countryside around Rome(campagna romana) by the 17th-century French artist Gaspare Dughet, Poussin’s brother-in-law, in the right aisle. The frescoes by Filippo Gagliardi, at either end of the left aisle, show old St Peter’s and the interior of San Giovanni in Laterano before Borromini’s redesign. If you can find the sacristan, you can go beneath the church to see the remains of Equitius’s house. |",EWTG_ROME170SANMAR,Viale del Monte Oppio 28,Rome,00184,Ancient Rome,,Italy,,06 478 4701,,,,,,,,,www.carmelit.org,,Cavour,,"16, 75, 714, 717, C3","8–11:30am & 4:30–7pm Mon–Sat, 8am–noon & 4–7:30pm Sun",,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,EUR,41.894523,12.498423,TRUE,,FALSE,,Religious Buildings,ESQUILINE |,,,"transport - local_railway: Cavour, Vittorio Emanuele. | church |",TRUE,san_martino_ai_monti_rome_superstock_1899_47538_reformat,"Nave columns, San Martino ai Monti ",&#169;Superstock/Photoservice Electa/Universal Images Group,1899-47538,SuperStock,Photoservice Electa,,,san_martino_ai_monti_rome_superstock_1899_47538_refo

The hospital came to be used by unmarried mothers, and one section was set aside for women who wished to be unknown. They were even permitted to wear a veil for the duration of their stay. Unwanted children were sent to an orphanage, and if any mothers or children died they were buried in anonymous graves. The hospital was abandoned in the early 20th century, and demolished in the 1930s during the excavation of the Mausoleum of Augustus.

rome_sight_0904,catalogue,Sant’Andrea delle Fratte,"When Sant’Andrea delle Fratte was built in the 12th century, this was the northernmost edge of Rome. Though the church is now firmly embedded in the city, its name (fratte means thickets) recalls its original setting. The church was completely rebuilt in the 17th century, partly by Borromini. His bell tower and dome, best viewed from the higher ground further up Via Capo le Case, are remarkable for the complex arrangement of concave and convex surfaces. The bell tower is particularly fanciful, with angel caryatids, flaming torches, and exaggerated scrolls like semi-folded hearts supporting a spiky crown. In 1842, the Virgin Mary appeared in the church to a Jewish banker, who promptly converted to Christianity and became a missionary. Inside, the chapel of the Miraculous Madonna is the first thing you notice. The church is better known, however, for the angels that Borromini’s rival, Bernini, carved for the Ponte Sant’Angelo. Pope Clement IX declared they were too lovely to be exposed to the weather, so they remained with Bernini’s family until 1729, when they were moved to the church. |",EWTG_ROME132SANAND,Via Sant’Andrea delle Fratte 1,Rome,00187,Piazza di Spagna & Trevi Fountain,,Italy,,06 679 3191,,,,,,,,,www.santandreadellefratte.it,,"Spagna, Barberini",,"116, 117",<p>6:30am–noon daily</p><p>Winter: 4–7pm daily</p><p>Summer: 4:30–7:30pm</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,EUR,41.903313,12.4834,TRUE,,FALSE,,Religious Buildings,PIAZZA DI SPAGNA |,,,church_services |,TRUE,sant_andrea_delle_fratte_rome_dk_AL545225,Sant’Andrea delle Fratte,&#169;dkimages,AL545225,,,,,sant_andrea_delle_fratte_rome_dk_AL54

The original design was by Raphael, who, like his master Bramante, had acquired a sense of the grandiose from the remains of Roman antiquity. The influence of some of Bramante’s works, such as the choir of Santa Maria del Popolo (see Santa Maria del Popolo), is evident in the simple way the arches and pilasters define the structure of the walls. The cupola of Sant’ Eligio is attributed to Baldassarre Peruzzi, while the façade was added in the early 17th century by Flaminio Ponzio. Among the various 16th-century painters who decorated the interior was Taddeo Zuccari, who worked on Palazzo Farnese (see Palazzo Farnese). |",EWTG_ROME148SANDEG,Via di Sant’Eligio 8A,Rome,00186,Piazza Navona & Campo de’ Fiori,,Italy,,06 686 8260,,,,,,,,,,,,,"23, 40, 46, 62, 64, 116, 280",9:30am–1pm Mon–Fri (call first at Via di Sant’Eligio 7),Aug,"Sat, Sun",,,,,,,,,,,,,EUR,41.8956507244827,12.4679607668647,TRUE,,FALSE,,Religious Buildings,"Churches, Temples and Shrines | CAMPO DE’ FIORI |",,,church_services |,TRUE,sant_eligio_degli_orefici_rome_alamy_cp5fj6,"Altar, Church of Sant 'Eligio degli Orefici",&#169;Alamy ImagesUniversal Images Group/DeAgostini,CP5FJ6,Alamy,Universal Images Group,,,sant_eligio_degli_orefici_rome_alamy_cp

It is one of the oldest in Rome, dating back to the fifth century, and was built on the remains of a Roman villa. Consecrated by Pope Gregory the Great, in the Middle Ages Santa Balbina was a fortified monastery and over time has changed in appearance several times, regaining its Romanesque aspect in the 1920s. From the piazza in front of the church, a staircase leads up to a three-arched portico. Inside, light streams in from a series of high windows along the length of the nave. The remains of St Balbina and her father, St Quirinus, are in an urn at the high altar, though the church’s real treasure is situated in the far right-hand corner: the magnificent sculpted and inlaid tomb of Cardinal Stefanis de Surdis by Giovanni di Cosma (1303). Other features worth noting are a 13th-century episcopal throne and various fragments of frescoes. These include a lovely Madonna and Child, an example of the school of Pietro Cavallini, in the second chapel on the left. Fragments of first-century Roman mosaics were also discovered in the 1930s.

Just inside the church is a small column against which Bibiana is said to have been whipped. Her remains, along with those of her mother Dafrosa and her sister Demetria, who also suffered martyrdom, are preserved in an alabaster urn below the altar.

The ambulatory that runs around the outside of the central arcade has a barrel-vaulted ceiling decorated with wonderful 4th-century mosaics of flora and fauna and charming scenes of a Roman grape harvest. In a niche on the far side of the church from the entrance is a replica of Constantia’s ornately carved porphyry sarcophagus. The original was moved to the Vatican Museums in 1790. Constantia’s sanctity is debatable – she was described by the historian Marcellinus as a fury incarnate, constantly goading her equally unpleasant husband Hannibalianus to violence.

In the crypt is a Roman statue of Juno, found at Ostia (see Ostia Antica), transformed into a statue of St Helena by replacing the head and arms and adding a cross. The 15th- century apse fresco shows the medieval legends that arose around the Cross. Helena is shown holding it over a dead youth and restoring him to life. Another episode shows its recovery from the Persians by the Byzantine Emperor Heraclitus after a bloody battle.

During the 15th century, Francesca of Trastevere founded a society of pious women devoted to helping the less fortunate. After her canonization in 1608 the church, originally named Santa Maria Nova, was rededicated to Francesca. The most curious sight inside the church is a flagstone with what are said to be the imprints of the knees of St Peter and St Paul. A magician, Simon Magus, decided to prove that his powers were superior to those of the Apostles by levitating above the Forum.

rome_sight_0952,catalogue,Santa Maria della Concezione,"Pope Urban VIII’s brother, Antonio Barberini was a cardinal and a Capuchin friar. In 1626 he founded this plain, unassuming church at what is now the foot of the Via Veneto. When he died he was buried not, like most cardinals, in a grand marble sarcophagus, but below a simple flag-stone near the altar, with the bleak epitaph in Latin: “Here lies dust, ashes, nothing”. The grim reality of death is illustrated even more graphically in the crypt beneath the church, where generations of Capuchin friars decorated the walls of the five vaulted chapels with the bones and skulls of their departed brethren. In all, some 4,000 skeletons were used over about 100 years to create this macabre memento mori started in the late 17th century. Some of the bones are wired together to form Christian symbols such as crowns of thorns, sacred hearts and crucifixes. There are also some complete skeletons, including one of a Barberini princess who died as a child. At the exit, an inscription in Latin reads: “What you are, we used to be.

The papal artillery officers insisted that the dome of the new church should be as low as possible, so it was built without a supporting drum.

Returning home after many years, he died as a servant, unrecognized, under the stairs of the family entrance hall, clutching the manuscript of his story for posterity. The original 5th-century church has undergone many changes over time. Noteworthy are the 18th-century façade with its five arches, the restored Cosmati doorway and pave-ment, and the magnificent Romanesque five-storey bell tower (1217).

The remains of medieval frescoes can be seen in the Chapel of Santa Barbara, but the convent’s main feature is the Chapel of St Sylvester – its remarkable frescoes (1246) recount the legend of the conversion to Christianity of the Emperor Constantine by Pope Sylvester I (reigned 314–35), then living as a hermit on Monte Soratte, north of Rome. Stricken by the plague, Constantine is prescribed a bath in children’s blood, to the horror of the matrons of Rome. Unable to bring himself to obey, Constantine is visited in a dream by St Peter and St Paul. They advise him to find Sylvester, who cures him and baptizes him. The final scene shows the emperor kneeling before the pope.

rome_sight_1027,catalogue,Scala Santa and Sancta Sanctorum,"On the east side of Piazza di San Giovanni in Laterano, a building designed by Domenico Fontana (1589) houses two surviving parts of the old Lateran Palace. One is the Sancta Sanctorum, the other the holy staircase, the Scala Santa. The 28 steps, said to be those that Christ ascended in Pontius Pilate’s house during his trial, are supposed to have been brought from Jerusalem by St Helena, mother of the Emperor Constantine. This belief, however, cannot be traced back any earlier than the 7th century. The steps were moved to their present site by Pope Sixtus V (reigned 1585–90) when the old Lateran Palace was destroyed. No foot may touch the holy steps, so they are covered by wooden boards. They may only be climbed by the faithful on their knees, a penance that is performed especially on Good Friday. In the vestibule there are various 19th-century sculptures including an Ecce Homo by Giosuè Meli (1874). The Scala Santa and two side stairways lead to the Chapel of St Lawrence or Sancta Sanctorum (Holy of Holies), built by Pope Nicholas III in 1278. Decorated with fine Cosmatesque marble-work, the chapel contains many important relics, the most precious being an image of Jesus – the Acheiropoeton or “picture painted without hands”, said to be the work of St Luke, with the help of an angel. It was taken on procession in medieval times to ward off plagues. On the walls and in the vault, restoration work has revealed 13th-century frescoes which for 500 years had been covered by later paintings. The frescoes, representing the legends of St Nicholas, St Lawrence, St Agnes and St Paul, show signs of the style that would characterize the frescoes of Giotto in Assisi, made a few years later. |",EWTG_ROME180SCASAN,Piazza di San Giovanni in Laterano 14,Rome,00184,Ancient Rome,,Italy,,06 772 6641,,,,,,,,,www.scalasanta.org,,San Giovanni,Porta San Giovanni- Carlo Felice,"16, 81, 85, 87, 186",6:30am–noon daily; Winter: 3–5pm daily; Summer: 3:30–6pm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,EUR,41.887147,12.506737,TRUE,,FALSE,,"Religious Buildings, Historic Sights and Landmarks",LATERAN |,,,transport - tram: 3. | church |,TRUE,scala_santa_and_sancta_sanctorum_rome_dk_AL228669,Scala Santa and Sancta Sanctorum,&#169;dkimages,AL228669,,,,,scala_santa_and_sancta_sanctorum_rome_dk_AL22

The Sabines, bent on vengeance for the rape of their women by Romulus and his men, bribed Tarpeia to let them up on to the Capitol. As the Augustan historian Livy records, the Sabines used to wear heavy gold bracelets and jewelled rings on their left hands, and Tarpeia’s reward for her treachery was to be “what they wore on their shield-arms”. The Sabines kept to the letter of the bargain if not to its spirit – they repaid Tarpeia not with their jewellery but by crushing her to death between their shields. Tarpeia was possibly the only casualty of her act of treachery – as the invading warriors met the Roman defenders, the Sabine women leapt between the two opposing armies, forcing a reconciliation. Traitors and other condemned criminals were subsequently executed by being thrown over the sheer face of the rock. The place has been considered dangerous and used to be fenced off, but restoration work is now under way. |",EWTG_ROME074TARROC,Via di Monte Caprino and Via del Tempio di Giove,Rome,00186,Ancient Rome,,Italy,,,,,,,,,,,,,Colosseo,Piazza Del Colosseo- Salvi,"30, 44, 44F, 81, 83, 85, 87, 130F, 160, 160F, 170, 175, 628, 781, C3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,EUR,41.891558698065,12.4824712820937,FALSE,,FALSE,,Historic Sights and Landmarks,Ancient Sites | CAPITOL |,,,xref: GETTING THERE |,,,,,,,,,,#VALUE!

Bramante chose the Doric order for the 16 columns surrounding the domed chapel. Above the columns is a Classical frieze and a delicate balustrade.

Byron muses over her unknown destiny in his poem Childe Harold. In 1302 Pope Boniface VIII donated the tomb to his family, the Caetani. They incorporated it in a fortified castle that blocked the Via Appia, allowing them to control the traffic on the road and exact high tolls. The marble facing of the tomb was pillaged by another pope, Sixtus V, at the end of the 16th century.

Scipio Africanus himself was not buried here in the family tomb, but at Liternum near Naples, where he owned a favourite villa. The Tomb of the Scipios was discovered in 1780. It contained various sarcophagi, statues and niches with terracotta burial urns. Many of the originals have now been moved to the Vatican Museums and copies stand in their place. The earliest sarcophagus was that of Cornelius Scipio Barbatus, consul in 298 BC, for whom the tomb was built. Members of his illustrious family continued to be buried here up to the middle of the 2nd century BC. Excavations in the area have revealed a columbarium similar to that of Pomponius Hylas, a Christian catacomb and a three-storey house dating from the 3rd century AD, which was built over the Tomb of the Scipios. |",EWTG_ROME195TOMSCI,Via di Porta San Sebastiano 9,Rome,00179,Ancient Rome,,Italy,,06 0608,,,,,,,,,,,,,"218, 360, 628",Guided tours only; phone ahead,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,EUR,41.876663,12.499479,TRUE,,FALSE,,Ancient Ruins,CARACALLA |,,,,TRUE,tomb_scipios_rome_getty_122221071,Bust of Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus,&#169;Getty Images/De Agostini,122221071,Getty Images,De Agostini,,,tomb_scipios_rome_getty_12222

In the 1960s Via Veneto was the most glamorous street in Rome, its luxury hotels and cafés patronized by film stars and plagued by paparazzi. It had a starring role in Federico Fellini’s film, La Dolce Vita (1960) – literally “the sweet life”. | At the foot of Via Veneto is the plain, unassuming church of Santa Maria della Concezione. The catacombs below the church, now a museum, belonged to the Capuchin Order, whose object was to make people confront the reality of death. They dismantled thousands of skeletons belonging to their departed brothers and used the bones to decorate the walls of the church’s labyrinthine underground chapels. Vertebrae are wired together to make sacred crowns, and clothed skeletons lie in niches constructed from pelvic bones that look like layers of sliced mushrooms. At the exit, an inscription in Latin translates as: “What you are, we used to be.

rome_sight_1248,catalogue,West of Viale di Trastevere,"The elegant, four-arched Ponte Sisto has linked Trastevere with the Campo de’ Fiori district since the 16th century. Commissioned by Pope Sixtus IV and built by Italian architect Baccio Pontelli, it remains the most evocative approach to the Tiber’s left bank and is busy day and night with people hurrying, strolling, chatting, cycling, scootering and sometimes even skating. The bridge is pierced by an oculus (eye), designed to warn Romans when the water level of the Tiber gets dangerously high. Ponte Sisto also serves as an aqueduct, carrying water across the river from the Fontana dell’Acqua Paola on the Janiculum Hill. To the west of Ponte Sisto is a 16th-century city gate, the Porta Settimiana. Overlooking it is Casa della Fornarina, a modest house, which now houses a restaurant. It is thought to have been home to Margherita Luti, the baker’s daughter with whom master painter Raphael fell in love. | From here stroll down to Via della Scala, one of Trastevere’s main pedestrian thoroughfares, lined with shops, restaurants and cafés. Located here is the Antica Farmacia Santa Maria della Scala, run by Carmelite monks, and first opened to the public in the 17th century. The pharmacy became famous among the Grand Tourists of the 18th and 19th centuries for its acqua della scala (anti-plague water). This is no longer on sale, but calling in advance helps gain access to the original pharmacy on the first floor. Here visitors can see alembics, distillation equipment, pestles and mortars and a device for making pills, along with a vase containing theriac, a supposed cure for snake bites. | Further along Via della Scala is the Museo di Roma, which hosts photography exhibitions occasionally. A short walk beyond is Piazza di Santa Maria in Trastevere, the traditional heart of the neighbourhood. |",EWFG_ROME188WESVIA,"Ponte Sisto: Piazza Trilussa, Porta Settimiana: Via di Porta Settimiana 8, Antica Farmacia Santa Maria della Scala: Piazza della Scala 23, Museo di Roma: Piazza Sant’Egidio 1B",Rome,00153,Trastevere & Janiculum Hill,,Italy,,"Museo di Roma: 06 0608, 06 581 6563, Santa Maria della Scala: 06 580 6217",,,,,,,,,www.museodiromaintrastevere.it,,,Trastevere- Mastai,"H, 23, 125, 271, 280 & 780","Museo di Roma: 10am–8pm Tue–Sun, 24 & 31 Dec: 10am–2pm",,"Museo di Roma: Mon, 1 Jan, 1 May, 25 Dec",,,,,TRUE,,"Antica Farmacia Santa Maria della Scala: book, Museo di Roma: call 060608",Antica Farmacia di Santa Maria della Scala: €5 per person for tours (minimum 5 people or pay the minimum price of €25).

rome_sight_1289,,Tivoli,"<p><strong>Tivoli</strong> has been a popular summer resort since the days of the Roman Republic. Among the famous men who owned villas here were the poets Catullus and Horace, Caesar&rsquo;s assassins Brutus and Cassius, and the Emperors Trajan and Hadrian. Tivoli&rsquo;s main attractions were its clean air and beautiful situation on the slopes of the Tiburtini hills, its healthy sulphur springs and the waterfalls of the Aniene &ndash; the Emperor Augustus said these had cured him of insomnia. The Romans&rsquo; luxurious lifestyle was revived in Renaissance times by the owners of the Villa d&rsquo;Este, the town&rsquo;s most famous sight.</p><p>In the Middle Ages Tivoli suffered frequent invasions as its position made it an ideal base for an advance on Rome. In 1461 Pope Pius II built a fortress here, the Rocca Pia, declaring: &ldquo;It is easier to regain Rome while possessing Tivoli, than to regain Tivoli while possessing Rome.&rdquo;</p><p>After suffering heavy bomb-damage in 1944, Tivoli&rsquo;s main buildings and churches were speedily restored. The town&rsquo;s cobbled streets are still lined with medieval houses. The Duomo (cathedral) houses a beautiful 13th-century life-size wooden group representing the <em>Deposition from the Cross</em>. Tivoli makes a good place to stop either before or after visiting Hadrian&rsquo;s Villa.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,a_tivoli_rome_glow_ADU0408.jpg,"Rocca Pia Castle, Tivoli ",&#169;Glow Images/Cubo Images/Andrea Durazzi,ADU0408,Glow Images,Andrea Durazzi,"Castle, Tivoli, Lazio, Italy",,a_tivoli_rome_glow_ADU0408
rome_sight_1290,,Villa d’Este,"The villa occupies the site of an old Benedictine convent. In the 16th century the estate was developed by Cardinal Ippolito d’Este, son of Lucrezia Borgia. A palace was designed by Pirro Ligorio to make the most of its hilltop situation, but the villa’s fame rests more on the terraced gardens and fountains laid out by Ligorio and Giacomo della Porta. | The gardens have suffered neglect in the past, but the grottoes and fountains still give a vivid impression of the great luxury which the princes of the church enjoyed. From the great loggia of the palace you descend through the privet-lined paths to the Grotto of Diana and Bernini’s Fontana del Bicchierone. Below to the right is the Rometta (little Rome), a model of Tiber Island with allegorical figures and the legendary she-wolf. The Rometta is at one end of the Viale delle Cento Fontane, 100 fountains in the shapes of grotesques, obelisks, ships and the eagles of the d’Este coat of arms. Other fountains are now being restored to their former glory. The Fontana dell’Organo is a water-organ, in which the force of the water pumps air through the pipes. The garden’s lowest level has flower beds and fountains as well as some splendid views out over the plain below. |",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,villa_este_rome_alamy_A9518A.jpg,Lush garden at Villa d’Este,&#169;Alamy Images/Peter Barritt ,A9518A,Alamy Images,Peter Barritt ,"Hydraulic ""Organ Fountain"" in gardens of the ""Villa D'Este"" Tivoli Rome Italy Europe EU",email bounced - villadestetivoli@telekottageplus.com,villa_este_rome_alamy_A9518A
rome_sight_1291,,Hadrian’s Villa,"Built as a private summer retreat between AD 118 and 134, Hadrian’s Villa was a vast open-air museum of the finest architecture of the Roman world. The grounds of the Imperial Palace covered an area of 120 hectares (300 acres) and were filled with full-scale reproductions of the emperor’s favourite buildings from Greece and Egypt. Although excavations on this site began in the 16th century, many of the ruins lying scattered in the surrounding fields have yet to be identified with any certainty. The grounds of the villa make a very picturesque site for a picnic, with scattered fragments of columns lying among olive trees and cypresses. | For an idea of how the whole complex would have looked in its heyday, study the scale model in the building beside the car park. The most important buildings are signposted and several have been partially restored or reconstructed. One of the most impressive is the so-called Maritime Theatre. This is a round pool with an island in the middle, surrounded by columns. The island, reached by means of a swing bridge, was probably Hadrian’s private studio, where he withdrew from the cares of the Empire to indulge in his two favourite pastimes, painting and architecture. There were also theatres, Greek and Latin libraries, two bathhouses, extensive housing for guests and the palace staff, and formal gardens with fountains, statues and pools. | Hadrian also loved Greek philosophy. One part of the gardens is thought to have been Hadrian’s reproduction of the Grove of Academe, where Plato lectured to his students. He also had a replica made of the Stoà Poikile, a beautiful painted colonnade in Athens, from which the Stoic philosophers took their name. This copy enclosed a great piazza with a central pool. The so-called Hall of the Philosophers close to the Poikile was probably a library. | The most ambitious of Hadrian’s replicas was the Canopus, a sanctuary of the god Serapis near Alexandria. For this a canal 119 metres (130 yards) long was dug and Egyptian statues were imported to decorate the temple and its grounds. This impressive piece of engineering has been restored and the banks of the canal are lined with caryatids. | Another picturesque spot in the grounds is the Vale of Tempe, the legendary haunt of the goddess Diana with a stream representing the river Peneios. Below ground the emperor even built a fanciful re-creation of the underworld, Hades, reached through underground tunnels, of which there were many linking the various parts of the villa. | Plundered by barbarians who camped here in the 6th and 8th centuries, the villa fell into disrepair. Its marble was burned to make lime for cement and Renaissance antiquarians contributed even further to its destruction. Statues unearthed in the grounds are on show in museums around Europe. The Vatican’s Egyptian Collection (see Exploring the Vatican’s Collections) has many fine works that were found here. |",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,hadrians_villa_rome_glow_iblpwn03734709.jpg,Ruins at Hadrian’s Villa,&#169;Glow Images/Funkystock/Paul Williams,iblpwn03734709,Glow Images,Paul Williams,,,hadrians_villa_rome_glow_iblpwn03734709
rome_sight_1292,,Ostia Antica,"In Republican times Ostia was Rome’s main commercial port and a military base defending the coastline and the mouth of the Tiber. The port continued to flourish under the Empire, despite the development of Portus, a new port slightly to the northwest, in the 2nd century AD. Ostia’s decline began in the 4th century, when a reduction in trade was combined with the gradual silting up of the harbour. Then malaria became endemic in the area and the city, whose population may have been nearly 100,000 at its peak, was totally abandoned. Buried for centuries by sand, the city is remarkably well preserved. The site is less spectacular than Pompeii or Herculaneum because Ostia died a gradual death, but it gives a more complete picture of life under the Roman Empire. People of all social classes and from all over the Mediterranean lived and worked here. Visitors can understand the layout of Ostia’s streets almost at a glance. The main road through the town, the Decumanus Maximus, would have been filled with hurrying slaves and citizens, avoiding the jostling carriages and carts, while tradesmen pursued their business under the porticoes lining the street. The floorplans of the public buildings along the road are very clear. Many were bathhouses, such as the Baths of the Cisiarii (carters) and the grander Baths of Neptune, named after their fine black-and-white floor mosaics. Beside the theatre, three large masks, originally part of the decoration of the stage, have been mounted on large blocks of tufa. Beneath the great brick arches that supported the semicircular tiers of seats were taverns and shops. Classical plays are put on here in the summer. The Tiber’s course has changed considerably since Ostia was the port of Rome. It once flowed past just to the north of Piazzale delle Corporazioni, the square behind the theatre. The corporations were the guilds of the various trades involved in fitting out and supplying ships: tanners and rope-makers, ship-builders and timber merchants, ships’ chandlers and corn weighers. There were some 60 or 70 offices around the square. Mosaics showing scenes of everyday life in the port and the names and symbols of the corporations can still be seen. There were also offices used by ship-owners and their agents from places as far apart as Tunisia and the south of France, Sardinia and Egypt. In one office, belonging to a merchant from the town of Sabratha in North Africa, there is a delightful mosaic of an elephant. The main cargo coming into Rome was grain from Africa. Much of this was distributed free to prevent social unrest. Although only men received this annona or corn dole, at times over 300,000 were eligible. In the centre of the square was a temple, probably dedicated to Ceres, goddess of the harvest. Among the buildings excavated are many large warehouses in which grain was stored before it was shipped on to Rome. The Decumanus leads to the Forum and the city’s principal temple, erected by Hadrian in the 2nd century AD and dedicated to Jove, Juno and Minerva. In this rather romantic, lonely spot, it is hard to imagine the Forum as a bustling centre, where justice was dispensed and officials met to discuss the city’s affairs. In the 18th century it was used as a sheepfold. Away from the main street are the buildings where Ostia’s inhabitants lived. The great majority were housed in rented apartments in blocks three or four storeys high known as insulae. These varied considerably in their comfort and decoration. The House of Diana was one of the smarter ones, with a balcony around the second floor, a private bathhouse and a central courtyard with a cistern where tenants came to collect their water. Around the ground floor of the block were shops, taverns and bars selling snacks and drinks. In the bar at the House of Diana you can see the marble counter used by customers buying their sausages and hot wine sweetened with honey. For the wealthy there were detached houses(domus) such as the House of the Dioscuri, which has fine mosaics, and the House of Cupid and Psyche, named after a statue there. This is now in the site’s Museo Ostiense, near the Forum, along with other sculptures and reliefs found in Ostia. Among the houses and shops there are other fascinating buildings including a laundry and the firemen’s barracks. The religions practised in Ostia reflect the cosmopolitan nature of the port. There are also no fewer than 18 temples dedicated to the Persian god Mithras, as well as a Jewish synagogue dating from the 1st century AD and a Christian basilica. A plaque records the death of St Augustine’s mother in a hotel here in AD 387. |",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ostia_antica_rome_glow_iblrai02035079.jpg,"Mosaic floor, Ostia Antica",&#169;Glow Images/Raimund Kutter,iblrai02035079,Glow Images,Raimund Kutter,"Mosaic floor in front of row of shops in the Piazzale delle Corporazioni, Square of the Guilds or Corporations, Ostia Antica archaeological site, ancient port city of Rome, Lazio, Italy, Europe",,ostia_antica_rome_glow_iblrai02035079
