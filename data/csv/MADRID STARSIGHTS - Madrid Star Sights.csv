The palace remained the official home of the Spanish royal family until Alfonso XIII left for exile in 1931. The distribution of rooms and the interior decoration were altered by successive monarchs. General Franco also used the palace &ndash; known at the time as the Palacio de Oriente &ndash; for official business, and would address the crowds from the balcony overlooking the Plaza de Oriente.

Room 11 has works by Titian (<em>St Jerome in the Wilderness</em> c.1575), Tintoretto and El Greco.</p><p>Room 12 begins with early Baroque, when artists started to break with the rigid Classical rules of the Renaissance and introduce elements of drama and pathos into their work. This new trend flourishes in the art in rooms 13&ndash;15, with examples from Italy, France and Spain, where the period corresponded with the Siglo de Oro (Golden Century) of the arts.

Rococo took Europe by storm at the beginning of the 18th century. It is best represented here in room 28 by Antoine Watteau&rsquo;s <em>The Rest</em> (c.1709) and <em>Pierrot Content</em> (c.1712), and by Fran&ccedil;ois Boucher&rsquo;s <em>La Toilette</em> (1742). However, the increasingly exaggerated forms of Rococo were eventually rejected in favour of more restrained and elegant lines. Meanwhile, different developments were taking shape across the ocean. Rooms 29&ndash;30 display 19th-century American painting. Landscape art fulfilled a need to express America&rsquo;s romantic spirit and pride in the land, as seen in the paintings of Thomas Cole. American artists were increasingly interested in depicting everyday scenes, such as idyllic fishing trips and strolls through the woods.</p><p>The coming of age of American art at the end of the century is represented by the paintings of Winslow Homer, especially <em>Waverly Oaks</em> (1864), James Whistler and John Singer Sargent.</p><p>In Europe, the 19th century saw the dawn of Romanticism (room 31), a transition best illustrated here through three works by Goya. The series also demonstrates a growing trend towards Realism, a shift that is plainly depicted in Constable&rsquo;s <em>The Lock</em> (1824).</p>",,,,,,

Artists whose work was rejected by Paris&rsquo;s art salon were displayed in a parallel Salon des Refus&eacute;s. This show of &ldquo;discarded art&rdquo; marked the birth of Impressionism. Some of the most highly regarded exponents of the movement are represented in rooms 32&ndash; 33, including Manet, Degas with <em>Swaying Dancer</em> (1877&ndash;9), Renoir and Sisley. Impressionism freed the artist and led to further developments, such as Post-Impressionism and Symbolism, which centred on the artist as an individual. Such is the case with Vincent van Gogh, represented here by <em>Les Vessenots in Auvers</em> (1890), Toulouse-Lautrec with Gaston Bonnefoy (1891), C&eacute;zanne with his <em>Portrait of a Farmer</em> (c.1905&ndash;6) and Gauguin, whose <em>Mata Mua</em> (c.1892), in room L, is now part of the Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection. A series of works in room 34, belonging to the Fauve school, demonstrates this short-lived movement based on bright colours and simplified forms.</p><p>A name that did endure was Expressionism, which started in Germany. This school drew on the artist&rsquo;s emotions, and sought to precipitate an emotion in the viewer. Its earliest practitioners were centred around the Dresden group, &ldquo;The Bridge&rdquo;, founded in 1905. Among its members was Karl Schmidt-Rottluf, whose <em>Autumn Landscape in Oldenburg</em> (1907) is shown here. The Expressionist art in rooms 35&ndash;40 includes Edward Hopper&rsquo;s <em>Hotel Room</em> (1931).</p><p>Eight ground-floor rooms (41&ndash;48) deal with modern and contemporary art, divided into three themes &ndash; &ldquo;Experimental Avant-Garde&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Synthesis of Modern&rdquo; and &ldquo;Surrealism, Figurative Tradition and Pop Art&rdquo;. Among the gems are Picasso&rsquo;s <em>Harlequin with a Mirror</em> (1923), Mark Rothko&rsquo;s <em>Green on Maroon</em> (c.1961), and portraits by Lucian Freud.</p>",,,,,,

Although the limited subject matter was in some ways a restriction, it also offered a sharp focus that seems to have suited Spanish painters.</p><p>Spain&rsquo;s early medieval art is represented somewhat sketchily in the Prado, but there are some examples, such as the anonymous mural paintings from the Holy Cross hermitage in Maderuelo, which show a Romanesque heaviness of line and forceful characterization.</p><p>Spanish Gothic art can be seen in the Prado in the works of Bartolom&eacute; Bermejo and Fernando Gallego. The sense of realism in their paintings was borrowed from Flemish masters of the time.</p><p>Renaissance features began to emerge in the works of painters such as Pedro de Berruguete, whose Auto-de-f&eacute; is both chilling and lively. St Catherine, by Fernando Y&aacute;&ntilde;ez de la Almedina, shows the influence of Leonardo da Vinci, for whom Y&aacute;&ntilde;ez probably worked while training in Italy.</p><p>What is often considered as a truly Spanish style &ndash; with its highly-wrought emotion and deepening sombreness &ndash; first started to emerge in the 16th century in the paintings of the Mannerists. This is evident in Pedro Machuca&rsquo;s fierce <em>Descent from the Cross</em> and in the <em>Madonnas</em> of Luis de Morales, &ldquo;the Divine&rdquo;. The elongation of the human figure in Morales&rsquo; work is carried to a greater extreme by Domenikos Theotocopoulos, who is better known as El Greco. Although many of his masterpieces remain in his adopted town of Toledo, the Prado has an impressive collection, including <em>The Nobleman with his Hand on his Chest</em>.</p><p>The Golden Age of the 17th century was a productive time for Spanish art. Jos&eacute; de Ribera, who lived in (Spanish) Naples, followed Caravaggio in combining realism of character with the techniques of chiaroscuro (use of light and dark) and tenebrism (large areas of dark colours, with a shaft of light). Another master who used this method was Francisco Ribalta, whose <em>Christ Embracing St Bernard</em> is here. Zurbar&aacute;n, known for still lifes and portraits of saints and monks, is also represented in the Prado.</p><p>This period, however, is best represented by the work of Diego de Vel&aacute;zquez. As Spain&rsquo;s leading court painter from his late twenties until his death, he produced scenes of heightened realism, royal portraits, and religious and mythological paintings. Examples of all of these are displayed in the Prado. Perhaps his greatest work is Las Meninas. Another great Spanish painter, Goya, revived Spanish art in the 18th century. He first specialized in cartoons for tapestries, then became a court painter. His work went on to embrace the horrors of war, as seen in <em>The 3rd of May in Madrid</em>, and culminated in a sombre series known as <em>The Black Paintings</em>.</p>",,,,,,

Works from the 16th century include the <em>Triumph of Death</em> by Brueghel the Elder.</p><p>There are nearly 100 canvases by the 17th-century Flemish painter Peter Paul Rubens, including <em>The Adoration of the Magi</em>.

Titian served as court painter to Charles V, and few works express the drama of Habsburg rule so deeply as his sombre painting The Emperor Charles V at M&uuml;hlberg.

A few artists, such as Sorolla, managed to break the mould, hinting at the dawn of a new era of artistic brilliance. An emerging middle class, particularly in places like the Basque countryand Barcelona, gave rise to a generation of innovative artists whose works constitute the introduction to this collection. There are early 20th century landscapes by Zuloaga and Regoyos and representations of the female figure by artists such as Anglada-Camarasa, Nonell and Julio Gonz&aacute;lez. You will find the brooding, dark-coloured works of Guti&eacute;rrez Solana, whose favourite subjects are the fiestas and the people of his native Madrid. Influenced by the Spanish masters, especially Goya, his paintings include <em>La Tertulia del Caf&eacute; de Pombo</em> (1920) and the menacing <em>La Procesi&oacute;n de la Muerte</em> (1930).</p><p>There are also works by Blanchard, Delaunay and Lipchitz. Hinting at Cubism, they make a good introduction to the work of Juan Gris. Trained as a graphic designer, Gris moved to Paris in 1906 where, under the influence of Picasso, he produced <em>Portrait of Josette</em> (1916) and <em>Guitar in Front of the Sea</em> (1925). Also displayed are works in metal by Zaragoza-born sculptor Pablo Gargallo (1881&ndash;1934). Gargallo&rsquo;s most important piece is <em>The Great Prophet</em> (1933), a bronze casting more than 2 m (6 ft) high, which he completed shortly before his death.</p>",,,,,,

Born in the Andalusian city of M&aacute;laga, Picasso embraced a wide variety of styles in the course of his long career, including Realism, Cubism and Surrealism. He defied classification, creating some of the most important works of art of the 20th century. The first image the visitor notices is the haunting <em>Woman in Blue</em> (1901) in room 201, one of Picasso&rsquo;s earliest works dating from his so-called &ldquo;blue&rdquo; period. In Room 206 is the most-visited piece in the collection &ndash; the vast <em>Guernica</em> (1937). Aside from its unquestionable artistic merits, the canvas has a deep historical significance for Spaniards, recalling one of the most harrowing episodes of the Spanish Civil War. The painting is complemented by a series of sketches and preliminary studies completed in the week following the bombing of the Basque town of Gernika-Lumo.</p><p>It is interesting to see many of the symbols Picasso chose for Guernica appearing in his earlier work, the <em>Minotauromaquia</em> (1935).

In the 1920s and 1930s he worked alongside Picasso and Gargallo in Paris, producing many three-dimensional pieces in the Cubist style. Look out for Gonz&aacute;lez&rsquo; humorous self-portrait entitled <em>T&ecirc;te dite &ldquo;Lapin&rdquo;</em> or <em>Head called &ldquo;Rabbit&rdquo;</em> (1930).

They sought mutual support in groups such as El Paso and Grupo 57, whose members included Antonio Saura, Manuel Millares and Eduardo Chillida.
