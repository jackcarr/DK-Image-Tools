rome_sight_0038,catalogue,Ara Pacis,"<p>Constructed under Emperor Augustus, the <strong>Ara Pacis</strong>, or Altar of Peace, is one of the most significant monuments of ancient Rome. It was erected in 9 BC to celebrate the peace and prosperity Augustus had brought to the Roman Empire after his victorious campaigns in Gaul and Spain.</p><p>Commissioned by the Senate, the Ara Pacis was positioned so that the shadow of the huge obelisk sundial on Campus Martius would fall upon it on Augustus&rsquo; birthday. Carved along the sides of the altar in Carrara marble are figures depicting a procession that took place on 4 July 13 BC &ndash; <em>lictors</em> (guards), <em>augurs</em> (soothsayers) and <em>flamines</em> (priests) are followed by Augustus and his family. The emperor&rsquo;s relatives can be identified, ranked by their position in the succession. At the time the heir apparent was Marcus Agrippa, husband of Augustus&rsquo;s daughter Julia. All the portraits in the relief are carved with extraordinary realism, even the innocent toddler clinging to his mother&rsquo;s skirts. A scale model of the Ara Pacis with a key helps to identify the characters, while a huge Caesar family tree makes it easier to work out who is related to whom.</p><p>The tale of the rediscovery of the Ara Pacis dates back to the 16th century, when the first panels were unearthed. One section ended up in Paris, another in Florence. Further discoveries were made in the late 19th century, when archaeologists finally realized just what they had found. What we see today has all been pieced together since 1938, in part original, in part facsimile. Since 2006 it has been encased in an ultramodern building of glass and travertine designed by the New York architect Richard Meier.</p><p>Visible from the Ara Pacis is an overgrown brick cylinder that is actually the Mausoleum of Augustus, where the emperor and his family were buried. The mausoleum is currently undergoing restoration and there are plans to re-open it &ndash; exactly 2,000 years after Augustus died in AD 14 &ndash; as part of a pedestrianized Tridente zone.</p>",,Lungotevere in Augusta,Rome,00186,Piazza di Spagna & Trevi Fountain,,Italy,06 0608,,,,,,,,,,,,www.arapacis.it,,,,"70, 81, 117, 119, 186, 224, 590, 628, 913, 913F, 913FL, 926, C3",9am–7pm Tue–Sun,,Mon,TRUE,,,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"Audioguides (€4) available from the ticket desk in Italian, English, French & Spanish",€30–40; EU under 18s €5.50; under 6s free |,8.50,6.50,0,Under 6s free,<p>Adults &euro;8.50</p><p>Concessions &euro;6.50</p><p>Children free</p><p>Under 6s free</p>,EUR,41.905818,12.475222,TRUE,,FALSE,Historic Sights and Landmarks,Historic Sights and Landmarks,famous-landmarks,Ara Pacis Rome,"The Ara Pacis, or Altar of Peace, was a monument created to celebrate Roman victories over Gaul and Spain.

rome_sight_0040,,Arch of Constantine,"<p>Dedicated in AD 315, the <strong>Arch of Constantine</strong> was one of the last Imperial monuments to be erected in Rome, and marks the victory of the first Christian emperor over his rival, Emperor Maxentius. Constantine credited his victory at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in AD 312 to a dream in which he had a vision of the Cross and heard the words &ldquo;in this sign you shall conquer&rdquo;. However, there is nothing Christian about the arch &ndash; in fact, it is mostly a pastiche of pagan elements taken from several earlier monuments. The beautiful roundels depicting hunting scenes come from a temple dedicated to Emperor Hadrian&rsquo;s male lover, Antinous, and there are statues of Dacian prisoners taken from Trajan&rsquo;s Forum and reliefs of Marcus Aurelius, including one in which he is distributing bread to the poor. Inside the arch are reliefs of Trajan&rsquo;s victory over the Dacians.

Aurelian ordered the wall&rsquo;s construction as a defence against Germanic tribes, whose raids were penetrating deeper and deeper into Italy. Some 18 km (11 miles) round, with 18 gates and 381 towers, the wall took in all the seven hills of Rome. Maxentius (AD 306&ndash;12) then raised the wall to almost twice its original height, making it near impassable. It acted as Rome&rsquo;s main defence until 1870, when it was breached by Italian artillery just by Porta Pia, close to today&rsquo;s British Embassy.</p><p>Of the Aurelian Wall’s 18 gates, many are still in use. Porta San Sebastiano is the largest and the best-preserved, having been rebuilt by Emperor Honorius in the 5th century AD. Originally the Porta Appia, after the Via Appia Antica it leads to, in Christian times it gradually became known as the Porta San Sebastiano, because the Via Appia led to the basilica and catacombs of San Sebastiano, which were popular places of pilgrimage. It was at Porta San Sebastiano that the last triumphal procession to enter the city by the Appian Way was received in state &ndash; that of Marcantonio Colonna after the victory of Lepanto over the Turkish fleet in 1571.</p><p>Today the gate&rsquo;s towers house a museum with prints and models showing the walls&rsquo; history.

Completed by Emperor Caracalla in AD 217, the baths functioned for about 300 years, until the plumbing was destroyed by invading Goths. Over 1,600 bathers at a time could enjoy these luxurious <em>thermae </em>free of charge.</p><p>A Roman bath was a serious business, beginning with a sort of Turkish bath, followed by a spell in the <em>caldarium</em>, a large hot room with pools of water to provide humidity. Then came the lukewarm <em>tepidarium</em>, a visit to the large central meeting place known as the <em>frigidarium</em>, and finally a plunge into the <em>natatio</em>, an open-air Olympic-sized swimming pool. For the rich, this was followed by a rub-down with scented woollen cloth.</p><p>Surrounded by grass and umbrella pines, the Baths of Caracalla is one of the most enjoyable ancient sites in the city. The marked route through the baths has lively information boards in English and Italian and takes visitors first to the <em>apodyterium</em> (dressing room), which has remains of mosaic pavements, and then to the huge <em>frigidarium</em>. The two granite bathtubs on Piazza Farnese were once here, with water cascading out of them into what was the <em>natatio.</em> Beyond this is evidence that part of the baths was originally on two levels &ndash; there is a stairway leading to nowhere, and fragments of the upper storey&rsquo;s mosaic pavements, decorated with tritons, dolphins, cupids and marine monsters, can be seen in the grass.</p><p>Although there are remnants of mosaics dotted throughout the site, most of the rich marble decorations of the baths were removed by the Farnese family in the 16th century to adorn the interior of Palazzo Farnese.

rome_sight_0173,,Colosseum,"<p>The <strong>Colosseum</strong>, Rome’s greatest amphitheatre, was commissioned by Emperor Vespasian in AD 72 on the marshy site of a lake in the grounds of Nero’s palace, the Domus Aurea. Here, the Imperial passion for bloody spectacle reached its peak of excess.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Emperors held shows here that often began with animals performing circus tricks. Then came the gladiators, who fought each other to the death. When one was killed, attendants dressed as Charon, the mythical ferryman of the dead, carried his body off on a stretcher, and sand was raked over the blood to prepare for the next bout. The games held in AD 248 to mark the thousandth anniversary of Rome’s founding saw the deaths of a host of lions, elephants, hippos, zebras and elks brought over from North Africa.</p><p>The Colosseum was built to a practical design, with 80 arched entrances allowing easy access for 55,000 spectators, but it is also a building of great beauty. It was one of several similar amphitheatres built in the Roman Empire, and some survive at El Djem in North Africa, N&icirc;mes and Arles in France, and Verona in northern Italy.

In fact, the impression of the work is more like that of the 4th-century Arch of Constantine than Trajan&rsquo;s monument. Gone are the heroic qualities of the Roman soldiers, by now mostly barbarian mercenaries, and a sense of respect for the vanquished. A new emphasis on the supernatural points to the end of the Hellenistic tradition and the beginning of Christianity.</p><p>The column was restored in 1588 by Domenico Fontana on the orders of Pope Sixtus V. The statue of Marcus Aurelius and his wife on the monument&rsquo;s summit was replaced by a bronze of St Paul.</p><p>The Column of Marcus Aurelius is 3.7 m (12 ft) in diameter and has an internal spiral staircase that leads to the top.

rome_sight_0214,catalogue,Domus Aurea,"<p>After allegedly setting fire to Rome in AD 64, Nero built himself an outrageous new palace. The <strong>Domus Aurea</strong> (sometimes called Nero&rsquo;s Golden House) occupied part of the Palatine and most of the Celian and Esquiline hills &ndash; an area approximately 25 times the size of the Colosseum.  </p><p>According to ancient Roman literature, the Domus Aurea&rsquo;s landscaped grounds had a huge artificial lake, complete with real ships and fake seaside villages, bath complexes, gardens, zoos, woods, grottos and elegant porticoes. The palace walls were allegedly adorned with gold and mother-of-pearl, rooms were designed with ceilings that showered guests with flowers or perfumes, the dining hall rotated and the baths were fed with both sulphurous water and sea water. As Nero killed himself in AD 68, he did not have long to enjoy his new home.</p><p>Nero&rsquo;s successors, anxious to distance themselves from the monster-emperor, did their utmost to erase all traces of the palace. Vespasian drained the lake and built the Colosseum in its place; Titus and Trajan each erected a complex of baths over the palace; and Hadrian placed the Temple of Venus and Rome over the vestibule.</p><p>Rooms from one wing of the palace have survived, buried beneath the ruins of the Baths of Trajan on the Oppian Hill. Excavations have revealed large frescoes and mosaics which are thought to be a panorama of Rome from a bird&rsquo;s-eye perspective. The site is currently closed for safety reasons, but hopefully more areas will open to the public when considered safe from landslides. </p>","EWTG_ROME175DOMAUR, EWFG_ROME094DOMAUR",Via della Domus Aurea 1,Rome,00184,Ancient Rome,,Italy,06 3996 7700,,,,,,,,,,,,archeoroma.beniculturali.it/en/archaeological-site/domus-aurea,,Colosseo,Piazza Del Colosseo-Salvi,"C3, 53, 85, 87, 117, 186, 571, 810",Closed to the public for restoration and consolidation work; call 06 0608 to check,,,,,,FALSE,,,,,,,,,<p>Free entry</p>,EUR,41.890667,12.494711,TRUE,,FALSE,FALSE,"Historic Sights and Landmarks, Ancient Ruins",famous-landmarks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Colle Oppio, Colosseum, Palatine, Aqueduct of Nero and the Freedmen’s Tombs."

The Nile&rsquo;s veiled head symbolizes the river&rsquo;s unknown source, but there is also a legend that the veil conveys Bernini&rsquo;s dislike for the nearby Sant&rsquo;Agnese in Agone, designed by his rival Francesco Borromini. Similarly, the athletic figure of the River Plate, cringing with arm upraised, is supposed to express Bernini&rsquo;s fear that the church would collapse.

As a result, the pope hastened to build a hospice for sick paupers.</p><p>In 1475, the hospital was reorganized by Pope Sixtus IV to care for the poor pilgrims expected for the Holy Year. Sixtus&rsquo;s hospital was a radical building, with cloisters dividing the different types of patients; one area is still reserved for orphans and their nurses. Unwanted infants were passed through a revolving barrel-like contraption called the rota &ndash; still visible to the left of the central entrance in Borgo Santo Spirito &ndash; to guarantee anonymity. Martin Luther, who visited in 1511, was shocked by the number of abandoned children he saw, believing them to be &ldquo;the sons of the pope himself&rdquo;.</p><p>In the centre, under the hospital&rsquo;s conspicuous drum, is an octagonal chapel where mass was said for patients.

Keats was suffering from consumption, and had been sent to Rome by his doctor in the hope that the mild, dry climate would help his recovery. Depressed about scathing criticism of his work, and tormented by his love for a young girl named Fanny Brawne, Keats died the following February, aged 25. His death inspired poet Percy Bysshe Shelley to write the poem <em>Mourn not for Adonais</em>. In July 1822, Shelley himself was drowned in a boating accident. Keats, Shelley and Severn are all buried at the Protestant cemetery in Testaccio.</p><p>In 1906 Casina Rossa house was bought by an Anglo-American association and preserved as a memorial and library in honour of English Romantic poets. The relics include a lock of Keats&rsquo;s hair, some fragments of Shelley&rsquo;s bones in a tiny urn and a garish carnival mask picked up by Lord Byron as a souvenir of a trip to Venice.

rome_sight_0423,,La Maddalena,"<p>This pretty church, which epitomizes the love of light and movement of the late Baroque, is always referred to as <strong>La Maddalena</strong> out of respect for the Virgin Mary. Catholics did not want the name Mary to be associated with Mary Magdalene, a sinner who had repented.</p><p>Built in 1735, the church’s curves are reminiscent of Borromini&rsquo;s San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane. The fa&ccedil;ade has been lovingly restored, although die-hard Neo-Classicists dismiss its painted stucco as &ldquo;icing sugar&rdquo;.</p><p>The small size of the Maddalena did not deter the 17th- and 18th-century decorators from filling the interior with ornaments, from the floor to the top of the elegant cupola. The organ loft and choir are particularly powerful examples of the Baroque&rsquo;s desire to fire the imagination of the faithful. Many of the paintings and sculptures adopt the Christian imagery of the Counter-Reformation. In the niches of the nave, the statues are personifications of virtues such as Humility and Simplicity.</p><p>There are also scenes from the life of San Camillo, who died in the adjacent convent in 1614. The church belonged to his followers, the Camillians, a preaching order active in Rome&rsquo;s hospitals. Like the Jesuits, they commissioned powerful works of art to convey the force of their religious message.</p><p>La Maddalena&rsquo;s fa&ccedil;ade is best admired while enjoying an ice cream from one of the great ice-cream parlours nearby.</p>",EWTG_ROME109LAMAD,Piazza della Maddalena,Rome,00186,Piazza Navona & Campo de’ Fiori,,Italy,06 899 281,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"30, 70, 81, 87, 116, 116T, 130F, 186, 492, 628, C3, N7","8:30–11:30am & 5–6:30pm Sun–Fri & public holidays, 9–11:30am Sat",,,TRUE,,FALSE,,,,,,0,0,0,,<p>Free entry</p>,EUR,41.900121,12.476751,TRUE,,FALSE,FALSE,Religious Buildings,places-of-worship,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The circular building was 87 m (285 ft) in diameter with two obelisks (now in Piazza del Quirinale and Piazza dell&rsquo;Esquilino) at the entrance. Inside were four concentric passageways linked by corridors where the urns containing the ashes of the Imperial family were placed.</p><p>The first person to be buried here was Augustus&rsquo;s favourite nephew, Marcellus, who had married Julia, the emperor&rsquo;s daughter. He died in 23 BC, possibly poisoned by Augustus&rsquo;s second wife Livia, who felt that her son, Tiberius, would make a more reliable emperor. When Augustus died in AD 14, his ashes were placed in the mausoleum, Tiberius duly became emperor and dynastic poisonings continued to fill the family vault with urns.</p><p>This sinister monument was later used as a medieval fortress, a vineyard, a private garden, and even, in the 18th century, as an auditorium and theatre. Under renovation, the mausoleum is now fenced off to the public but visitors can still admire this impressive and important site. There are plans to re-open the mausoleum exactly 2,000 years after Augustus died in AD 14 as part of a pedestrianized Tridente zone.</p>","EWTG_ROME141MAUAUG, TT_ROME090PANTHE_007_R12",Piazza Augusto Imperatore,Rome,00186,Piazza di Spagna & Trevi Fountain,,Italy,06 0608,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Spagna,,"81, 119, 224, 590, 628, 913, 913F, 926, C3",Closed for restoration,,,,,,,,,,Free |,0,0,0,,<p>Free entry</p>,EUR,41.905926,12.476412,TRUE,,FALSE,FALSE,Ancient Ruins,famous-landmarks,,,PIAZZA DI SPAGNA |,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As soon as it was unveiled, it was said to be frowning at having been brought into the world by such an inept sculptor.</p><p>The side reliefs also illustrate water stories from the Old Testament: Aaron leading the Israelites to water and Joshua pointing the army towards the Red Sea.

In 10 BC Emperor Augustus laid out an enormous sundial in the Campus Martius. Its centre was roughly in today&rsquo;s Piazza di San Lorenzo in Lucina. The shadow was cast by a huge granite obelisk that he had brought back from Heliopolis in Egypt. Unfortunately this sundial too became inaccurate after only 50 years, possibly due to subsidence. The obelisk was still in the piazza in the 9th century, but then disappeared until it was rediscovered lying under medieval houses in the reign of Pope Julius II (1503&ndash;13). The pope was intrigued, because Egyptian hieroglyphs were thought to hold the key to the wisdom of Adam before the Fall, but it was only under Pope Benedict XIV (reigned 1740&ndash;58) that the obelisk was finally unearthed. </p>",EWTG_ROME113OBEMON,Piazza di Montecitorio,Rome,00186,Piazza Navona & Campo de’ Fiori,,Italy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"81, 117, 119, 628, N6, N25",,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,<p>Free entry</p>,EUR,41.900676,12.478666,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,Fountains and Obelisks,famous-landmarks,,,Monuments and Tombs | PIAZZA DELLA ROTONDA |,,,location: Piazza di Montecitorio. |,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Piazza del Popolo, Fontana delle Quattro Fiumi, Obelisk of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, San Giovanni in Laterano"

The two buildings identified as the House of Augustus and the House of Livia, his wife, are among the best preserved here. The first emperor&rsquo;s example of frugality was ignored by his successors, Tiberius, Caligula and Domitian, who all built extravagant palaces here. The ruins of Tiberius&rsquo;s palace lie beneath the 16th-century Farnese Gardens.

The ceiling frescoes celebrate Marcantonio Colonna&rsquo;s victory over the Turks at the Battle of Lepanto (1571). On the walls are 16th- to 18th-century paintings, including Annibale Carracci&rsquo;s <em>The Bean Eater</em>. The room of landscape paintings, many by Poussin&rsquo;s brother-in-law Gaspare Dughet, reflects the 18th-century taste of Cardinal Girolamo Colonna. Beyond is a room with a ceiling fresco of <em>The Apotheosis of Martin V</em>. The throne room has a chair reserved for visiting popes and a copy of Pisanello&rsquo;s portrait of Martin V. The gallery also offers a fine view of the private palace garden, site of the ruined Temple of Serapis.</p>","EWTG_ROME158PALCOL, TT_ROME112BESRES_007",Piazza dei Santi Apostoli 66,Rome,00187,Piazza di Spagna & Trevi Fountain,,Italy,06 678 4350,,,,,,,,,,,,www.galleriacolonna.it/,,,,"H, 40, 64, 70, 170","9am–1:15pm Sat only or by appointment, closed Aug",Aug,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>Free entry</p>,EUR,41.898154,12.483271,TRUE,,FALSE,FALSE,"Historic Sights and Landmarks, Art Galleries and Museums",art-galleries,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Palazzo Doria Pamphilj

Built for Cardinal Domenico Riario in 1510&ndash;12, it has boasted among its many distinguished guests Bramante, the young Michelangelo, Erasmus and Queen Christina of Sweden, who died here in 1689. The old palazzo was completely rebuilt for Cardinal Neri Corsini by Ferdinando Fuga in 1736. As Via della Lungara is too narrow for a good frontal view, Fuga designed the fa&ccedil;ade so it could be seen from an angle. </p><p>Today, Palazzo Corsini houses the Galleria Nazionale d&rsquo;Arte Antica. This outstanding collection includes paintings by Rubens, Van Dyck, Murillo, Caravaggio and Guido Reni, together with 17th- and 18th-century Italian regional art. The palazzo is also home to the Accademia dei Lincei, a learned society founded in 1603 which once included Galileo among its members. In 1797 Palazzo Corsini was the backdrop for momentous events: French General Duphot (the fianc&eacute; of Napoleon&rsquo;s sister Pauline) was killed here in a skirmish between papal troops and Republicans. The consequent French occupation of the city and the deportation of Pope Pius VI led to the proclamation of a short-lived Roman Republic (1798&ndash;9).</p>",EWTG_ROME218PALCOR,Via della Lungara 10,Rome,00165,Trastevere & Janiculum Hill,,Italy,06 680 2323,,,,,,,,,,,,galleriacorsini.beniculturali.it,,,,"23, 280",8:30am–7:30pm Tue–Sun,,"1 Jan, 25 Dec",TRUE,,,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,,,<p>Free entry</p>,EUR,41.8933287633333,12.46693048,TRUE,,FALSE,FALSE,"Historic Sights and Landmarks, Art Galleries and Museums",art-galleries,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Palazzo Barberini, Botanical Gardens"

Pope Paul was a very shrewd financier and he encouraged Romans to deposit their money at the bank by offering the vast estates of the Hospital of Santo Spirito as security. The system catered only for the rudimentary banking requirements of the population, but business was brisk as people deposited money here safe in the knowledge that they could get it out simply by presenting a chit. The hospital coffers also gained from the system.

Michelangelo, who took over after Sangallo, contributed the great cornice and central window of the main fa&ccedil;ade, and the third level of the courtyard. Michelangelo had a plan to connect the Farnese gardens to the Farnese home in Trastevere, <strong>Villa Farnesina</strong>, via a bridge; the elegant arch spanning Via Giulia belongs to this sadly unrealized scheme.

It was the residence of Medici cousins Giovanni and Giuliano, both of whom became popes: Giovanni as Leo X and Giuliano as Clement VII. Caterina de&rsquo; Medici, Clement VII&rsquo;s niece, also lived here before she was married to Henry, son of King Francis I of France, in 1533. The palazzo takes its name from Madama Margherita of Austria, illegitimate daughter of Emperor Charles V, who married Alessandro de&rsquo; Medici and, after his death, Ottavio Farnese. Thus part of the art collection of the Florentine Medici family was inherited by the Roman Farnese family. The spectacular fa&ccedil;ade was built in the 17th century by Paolo Maruccelli. He gave it an ornate cornice and whimsical decorative details on the roof. Since 1871 the palazzo has been the seat of the upper house of the Italian parliament. </p>","EWTG_ROME122PALMAD, TT_ROME082PIANAV_010",Corso del Rinascimento,Rome,00186,Piazza Navona & Campo de’ Fiori,,Italy,06 670 61,,,,,,,,,,,,www.senato.it,,,,"30, 70, 81, 87, 116, 116T, 130F, 186, 492, 628, C3, N7","10am–6pm first Sat of month (tickets available from 8.30am on day of visit), closed Aug",Aug,,,,,,TRUE,,,,0,0,0,,<p>Free entry</p>,EUR,41.899171,12.474107,TRUE,,FALSE,FALSE,Historic Sights and Landmarks,famous-landmarks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Palazzo di Montecitorio, Palazzo del Quirinale"

Peruzzi displayed great ingenuity in dealing with an awkwardly shaped site. The previous building had stood on the ruined Theatre of Domitian, which created a curve in the great processional Via Papalis. Peruzzi&rsquo;s convex colonnaded fa&ccedil;ade follows the line of the street. His originality is also evident in the small square upper windows, the courtyard and the stuccoed vestibule. The Piazza de&rsquo; Massimi entrance has a Renaissance-style, frescoed fa&ccedil;ade.

rome_sight_0637,catalogue,Palazzo Massimo alle Terme,"<p>One of the four branches of the Museo Nazionale Romano, the luminous <strong>Palazzo Massimo alle Terme</strong> has an exceptional and beautifully displayed collection of exhibits dating from the 2nd century BC to the end of the 4th century AD. The palazzo, built in 1883&ndash;7 on the site of a villa which belonged to Sixtus V, used to be a Jesuit college. In 1981&ndash;97 it was restored to house a significant proportion of the museum&rsquo;s collections.  </p><p>The basement contains an excellent display of ancient coins, precious artifacts and the only mummified child to be found in the ancient city. The ground floor is devoted to Roman statuary, with funeral monuments in Room 2 and Emperor Augustus in Pontifex Maximus guise in Room 5. Upstairs there are statues from Nero&rsquo;s summer villa in Anzio and Roman copies of famous Greek originals, such as the <em>Discobolos Ex-Lancellotti</em>. The real joy of the museum, however, is on the second floor, where entire rooms of wall paintings have been brought from various villas excavated in and around Rome; a guided tour can be arranged at the museum entrance. The most incredible frescoes are from Livia&rsquo;s Villa at Prima Porta. Her <em>triclinium</em> (dining room) was decorated with an abundance of trees, plants and fruit, painted in a totally naturalistic style to fool guests that they were eating al fresco, rather than indoors. Other marvels include rooms brought from the first Villa Farnesina: the children&rsquo;s room has a predominantly white design, while the adults&rsquo; bedroom is red, and complete with erotic paintings. Equally impressive is the museum&rsquo;s display of mosaics on the same floor.</p>","TT_ROME028MUSNAZ_016, EWTG_ROME163MUSNAZ, EWFG_ROME098PALMAS, TT_ROME126ESQLAT_002, TT_ROME006ROMHIG_007, TT_ROME028MUSNAZ_017_R13, TT_ROME042MUSGAL_002","Palazzo Massimo, Largo di Villa Peretti 1",Rome,00185,Piazza di Spagna & Trevi Fountain,,Italy,06 3996 7700,,,,,,,,,,,,archeoroma.beniculturali.it/en/museums/national-roman-museum-palazzo-massimo-alle-terme,Termini,Termini,Termini,"C2, H, 36, 38, 40, 64, 86, 90, 92, 105, 170, 175, 217, 310, 360, 714, 910",9am–7:45pm Tue–Sun,,"Mon, 1 Jan, 25 Dec",TRUE,,,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"Free tours of Palazzo Massimo every Sunday at 10am, in Italian; audioguides (€5.50 for 70 minutes) are available in English, Spanish, French, Italian and German",,7,3.50,0,"EU citizens under 17 and over 65 free; single ticket valid for 3 days at 4 sites (Palazzo Massimo, Palazzo Altemps, Crypta Balbi, Baths of Diocletian)","<p>Adults &euro;7.00</p><p>Concessions &euro;3.50</p><p>Children free</p><p>EU citizens under 17 and over 65 free; single ticket valid for 3 days at 4 sites (Palazzo Massimo, Palazzo Altemps, Crypta Balbi, Baths of Diocletian)</p>",EUR,41.9014544154935,12.4983792006969,TRUE,,FALSE,FALSE,Art Galleries and Museums,museums,,,,,,,Mostri.

rome_sight_0657,catalogue,Palazzo Valentini,"<p>In 2005, builders at work beneath <strong>Palazzo Valentini</strong>, the seat of the Province of Rome, discovered what turned out to be the remains of two grand houses (Domus Romane) that had belonged to wealthy patrician families of Imperial Rome. Elegant living rooms, courtyards, baths and kitchens were unearthed, with traces of mosaics, frescoes and coloured marbles. Computer technology, films and projections have been used to virtually reconstruct the houses, resulting in a museum that brings ancient Rome to life better than anywhere else in the city. </p><p>Tours take visitors to a <em>caldarium</em> with a Jacuzzi-like hot tub, a <em>tepidarium</em> (lukewarm-water bath) where bathers would relax over a game of chequers, and a <em>frigidarium</em> (cold-water bath) that opened onto a garden, with a swimming pool and a pool for children. Mosaic floors, marble pavements and walls have been restored to their former glory, while sound effects re-create the earthquake that buckled the floors in AD 38. During the Renaissance, the area was used as a <em>butto</em> (rubbish dump). This too has been reconstructed in the museum. A sheep&rsquo;s horn, oyster shells, chicken bones, clam and tortoise shells found here give useful clues about the diet of Renaissance Romans. A second, shorter, itinerary takes visitors to a newly excavated section of Trajan&rsquo;s Forum.

Michelangelo proposed adding the Palazzo Nuovo to form a piazza in the shape of a trapezium, embellished with Classical sculptures chosen for their relevance to Rome. Building started in 1546 but progressed so slowly that Michelangelo only lived to oversee the double flight of steps at the entrance of Palazzo Senatorio. The piazza was completed in the 17th century, the design remaining largely faithful to the original.

Twin Neo-Classical fa&ccedil;ades stand on either side of the Porta del Popolo; an Egyptian obelisk rises in the centre; and the matching domes and porticoes of Santa Maria dei Miracoli and Santa Maria in Montesanto flank the beginning of Via del Corso.</p><p>Although it is now one of the most unified squares in Rome, Piazza del Popolo evolved gradually over the centuries. In 1589 the great town-planning pope, Sixtus V, had the 3,000-year-old obelisk erected in the centre by Domenico Fontana. Almost a century later Pope Alexander VII commissioned Carlo Rainaldi to build the twin Santa Marias. In the 19th century the piazza was turned into a grandiose oval by Giuseppe Valadier, the designer of the Pincio Gardens. He also encased Santa Maria del Popolo in a Neo-Classical shell to make its south fa&ccedil;ade fit in better with the overall appearance of the piazza.</p><p>In contrast to Piazza del Popolo&rsquo;s air of ordered rationalism, many of the events staged here were barbaric. In the 18th and 19th centuries, public executions were held in the piazza, often as part of the celebration of Carnival. Condemned men were sometimes hammered to death by repeated blows to the temples. The riderless horse races from the piazza down Via del Corso were scarcely more humane: the performance of the runners was enhanced by feeding the horses stimulants, wrapping them in nail-studded ropes, and letting off fireworks at their heels.</p>","EWTG_ROME137PIADEL, TT_ROME046SQUFOU_004, TT_ROME108SPASTE_007_R12, EWFG_ROME150PIADEL",Piazza del Popolo,Rome,00187,Piazza di Spagna & Trevi Fountain,,Italy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Flaminio,,"95, 117, 119, 490, 495, 926",,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>Free entry</p>,EUR,41.9105986907583,12.4760477989912,FALSE,,FALSE,Fountains and Obelisks,"Fountains and Obelisks, Historic Sights and Landmarks",outdoors,Piazza del Popolo Rome,"Piazza del Popolo is one of Rome’s largest squares, with a 3,000-year-old obelisk in its centre.

Each reclines on an aquatic creature symbolizing water in its various forms: a sea-horse for the oceans, a water snake for rivers, a swan for lakes, and a curious frilled lizard for subterranean streams.

Notable residents have included poets Keats, Shelley and Byron, and composers Liszt and Wagner.</p><p>In the 17th century, Spain&rsquo;s ambassador to the Holy See had his headquarters on the square, and the area around it was deemed to be Spanish territory. Foreigners who unwittingly trespassed were liable to be dragooned into the Spanish army. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Rome was almost as popular with visitors as it is today, and the square stood at the heart of the city&rsquo;s main hotel district. Some of the travellers came in search of knowledge and artistic inspiration, but most were more interested in gambling, collecting ancient statues and conducting love affairs with Italian women. </p><p>The Fontana della Barcaccia in the square is the least showy of Rome&rsquo;s Baroque fountains, and it is often completely screened from view by people resting on its rim. It was designed either by the famous Gian Lorenzo Bernini or by his father Pietro. Because the pressure from the aqueduct that feeds the fountain is extremely low there are no spectacular cascades or spurts of water. Instead, Bernini constructed a leaking boat &ndash; <em>barcaccia</em> means useless, old boat &ndash; which lies half submerged in a shallow pool. The bees and suns that decorate the Fontana della Barcaccia are taken from the family coat of arms of Pope Urban VIII Barberini, who commissioned the fountain.</p>","EWTG_ROME133PIADI, EWFG_ROME142PIADI",Piazza di Spagna,Rome,00187,Piazza di Spagna & Trevi Fountain,,Italy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Spagna,,"116, 117, 119, 590",,,,TRUE,Not on the steps,,,,,,,,,,,<p>Free entry</p>,EUR,41.905679,12.482314,FALSE,,FALSE,Fountains and Obelisks,"Fountains and Obelisks, Historic Sights and Landmarks",outdoors,Piazza di Spagna Rome ,"Piazza di Spagna is perhaps the most famous and crowded square in Rome, thronged with tourists.

The entrance is in a fa&ccedil;ade built to overlook Corso Vittorio Emanuele II when the road was constructed at the start of the 20th century. The original fa&ccedil;ade on the left of today&rsquo;s entrance is attributed to Antonio da Sangallo the Younger. Note the asymmetrical arrangement of its windows and ledges. The elegant central courtyard also retains its original appearance. </p><p>The Piccola Farnesina now houses the Museo Barracco, a collection of ancient sculpture assembled during the last century by the politician Baron Giovanni Barracco, a bust of whom can be seen in the courtyard.

Work on the walls, which measure 3 km (2 miles) in circumference, started in AD 846. Pope Leo supervised the huge army of labourers personally, and thanks to his encouragement, the job was completed in four years. He then consecrated his massive feat of construction. Since the time of Pope Leo the walls have needed much reinforcement and repair. The gateway visible today at Porta Santo Spirito was built by the architect Antonio da Sangallo the Younger in 1543&ndash;4. It is framed by two huge bastions that were added in 1564 by Pope Pius IV Medici. Sadly, Sangallo&rsquo;s design for a monumental entrance to the Vatican was never completed; the principal columns come to an end somewhat abruptly in a modern covering of cement.</p>",EWTG_ROME226PORSAN,Via dei Penitenzieri,Rome,00193,The Vatican,,Italy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"23, 34, 46, 62, 64, 98, 870, 881, 982",,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>Free entry</p>,EUR,41.900299,12.461599,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,Historic Sights and Landmarks,famous-landmarks,,,Monuments and Tombs | VATICAN |,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The part we see today is the great central atrium, which was originally covered by marble facings. In the Middle Ages a great fish market and a church, Sant&rsquo;Angelo in Pescheria, were built in the ruins of the portico. As the church was associated with the fishing activities of the nearby river port, aquatic flora and fauna feature in many of its inlays. Links with the Tiber are also apparent in the stucco fa&ccedil;ade on the adjacent Fishmonger&rsquo;s Oratory, built in 1689.

Gradually it rose, ever more glorified, as Rome&rsquo;s power grew. After the marsh was finally drained in the 6th century BC, the Forum took on its central role in the life of the Republic. As Rome&rsquo;s population boomed, the Forum became too small. In 46 BC Julius Caesar built a new one, setting a precedent that was followed by emperors from Augustus to Trajan.</p><p>To appreciate the layout of the Forum it is best to view the whole area from above, from the back of the Capitol. From here you can make out the Via Sacra (the Sacred Way), the route followed by religious and triumphal processions towards the Capitol.

The solemn travertine fa&ccedil;ade was completed later, in 1638, by the Roman architect Soria. The 16th-century basilican plan is flanked by chapels; the St Cecilia chapel was designed and decorated by Antonio Gherardi, who added a family portrait. The church&rsquo;s paintings and frescoes by Pietro da Cortona and Guido Reni are mature works of the Counter-Reformation, depicting the life and acts of the recently canonized San Carlo.

rome_sight_0813,,San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane,"<p>Borromini&rsquo;s compact masterpiece, <strong>San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane</strong> (also known as &ldquo;San Carlino&rdquo;) is so small that it would fit inside one of the piers of St Peter&rsquo;s. The church was commissioned in 1634 by the Trinitarians, a Spanish order whose role was to pay the ransoms of Christian hostages to the Arabs.</p><p>Although dedicated to Carlo Borromeo, the 16th-century Milanese cardinal canonized in 1620, San Carlo is as much a monument to Borromini; the church&rsquo;s radical design is about as freeform as architecture could be in the 17th century. Both the fa&ccedil;ade and interior employ bold curves that give light and life to a small, cramped site. The oval dome and tiny lantern are particularly ingenious. The undulating lines of the fa&ccedil;ade are decorated with angels and a statue of San Carlo. Finished in 1667, the fa&ccedil;ade is one of Borromini&rsquo;s very last works. There are further delights in the playful inverted shapes in the cloister and the stucco work in the refectory (now the sacristy), which houses a painting of San Carlo by Orazio Borgianni (1611). In a small room off the sacristy hangs a portrait of Borromini himself wearing the Trinitarian cross. Borromini committed suicide in 1667, and in the crypt (which is now open to the public) a small curved chapel reserved for him remains empty.</p>","EWTG_ROME161SANCAR, TT_ROME132QUIVIA_010",Via del Quirinale 23,Rome,00187,Piazza di Spagna & Trevi Fountain,,Italy,06 488 3109,,,,,,,,,,,,www.sancarlinoborromini.it,,Barberini,,"52, 53, 62, 63, 83, 85, 116, 160, 160F, 175, 492, 590, C3, N4, N5","10am–1pm daily, 3–6pm Mon–Fri, 10am–1pm Sat & Sun",,,TRUE,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,<p>Free entry</p>,EUR,41.901856,12.490572,TRUE,,FALSE,FALSE,Religious Buildings,places-of-worship,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sant’Andrea al Quirinale

The interior, remodelled by Francesco Ferrari in the mid-18th century, is Baroque, apart from the fine mosaic floor and some ancient columns. At the end of the right aisle is the chapel of St Gregory. Leading off it, another small chapel, believed to have been the saint&rsquo;s own cell, houses his episcopal throne &ndash; a Roman chair of sculpted marble. The Salviati Chapel on the left contains a picture of the Virgin said to have spoken to St Gregory.

rome_sight_0847,,San Luigi dei Francesi,"<p>The star sight inside <strong>San Luigi dei Francesi</strong>, the national church of France in Italy, is Caravaggio&rsquo;s famous trio of enormous paintings in the Chapel of St Matthew. These were the artist&rsquo;s first great religious works. The first, <em>The Calling of St Matthew</em>, shows the saint being called by Jesus and St Peter from the tax office. Light glints on the rims of coins, shimmers on velvets, brocades and an ostrich plume, and spotlights the faces of the main subjects. The second, <em>The Martyrdom of St Matthew</em>, is bathed in a sickly, greenish light and depicts the saint&rsquo;s martyrdom. The third, <em>The Inspiration of St Matthew</em>, reveals how the artist&rsquo;s plebeian, naturalistic approach often ran foul of Counter-Reformation tastes. This is Caravaggio&rsquo;s second attempt at the scene and shows St Matthew talking to an airborne angel. Caravaggio&rsquo;s first attempt at this scene was rejected by the priests of San Luigi, who objected to Matthew appearing as a dishevelled and apparently illiterate peasant &ndash; the angel appears to be teaching him to read.

The decoration of the next chapel was interrupted by the Sack of Rome in 1527. Raphael&rsquo;s follower Perin del Vaga fled, leaving the ceiling frescoes to be completed by Daniele da Volterra and Pellegrino Tibaldi when peace returned to the city.

rome_sight_0854,catalogue,San Marco,"<p>Founded in 336 by Pope Mark, whose relics lie underneath the altar, <strong>San Marco</strong> was created in honour of St Mark the Evangelist. The church was restored by Pope Gregory IV in the 9th century &ndash; the magnificent apse mosaics date from this period. Further major rebuilding took place in 1455&ndash;71, when Pope Paul II Barbo made San Marco the church of the Venetian community in Rome. The blue and gold coffered ceiling is decorated with Pope Paul&rsquo;s heraldic crest, the lion rampant, recalling the lion of St Mark, the patron saint of Venice. The appearance of the rest of the interior, with its colonnades of Sicilian jasper, was largely the creation of Filippo Barigioni in the 1740s. Complemented by an interesting array of funerary monuments in the aisles, the style is typical of the late Roman Baroque.

His church was replaced in about AD 500 by St Symmachus, rebuilt in the 9th century and then transformed completely in the 1630s. The only immediate signs of its age are the ancient Corinthian columns dividing the nave and aisles. The most interesting interior features are a series of frescoed landscapes of the countryside around Rome by the 17th-century French artist Gaspare Dughet, Poussin&rsquo;s brother-in-law, in the right aisle.

When the tomb was commissioned in 1505, Michelangelo spent eight months searching for perfect blocks of marble at Carrara in Tuscany, but Pope Julius became more interested in the building of a new St Peter&rsquo;s and the project was laid aside. After the pope&rsquo;s death in 1513, Michelangelo resumed work on the tomb, but had only finished the statues of <em>Moses</em> and <em>The Dying Slaves</em> when Pope Paul III persuaded him to start work on the Sistine Chapel&rsquo;s <em>Last Judgment</em>. Michelangelo had planned a vast monument with over 40 statues, but the tomb that was built &ndash; mainly by his pupils &ndash; is simply a fa&ccedil;ade with six niches for statues. <em>The Dying Slaves</em> are in Paris and Florence, but the tremendous bearded <em>Moses</em> remained in situ. The marble from which he is chiselled is warm-toned and gleaming, almost as if he might rise to his feet at any moment and remonstrate with the world in a thunderous voice.</p><p>The original 4th-century shrine was built here to house the <em>vincoli</em> (chains) thought to have been used to bind St Peter in prison. In the 5th century, Empress Eudoxia deposited one of the chains in a church in Constantinople and sent the other to her daughter Eudoxia in Rome.

rome_sight_0872,catalogue,San Rocco,"<p><strong>San Rocco</strong>, which is named after a healer of the plague-stricken, began life as the chapel of a 16th-century hospital with beds for 50 men. A maternity wing was added for the wives of Tiber bargees to save them from having to give birth in the insanitary conditions of a boat. The hospital came to be used by unmarried mothers, and one section was set aside for women who wished to be unknown. They were even permitted to wear a veil for the duration of their stay. Unwanted children were sent to an orphanage, and if any mothers or children died they were buried in anonymous graves. The hospital was abandoned in the early 20th century, and demolished in the 1930s during the excavation of the Mausoleum of Augustus.

The church contains the first great altarpiece by the 17th-century artist Pietro da Cortona, <em>The Birth of Jesus</em>, in the first chapel to the right. The adjacent convent of San Giorgio, to the left, has a pretty Renaissance cloister, a frescoed refectory and the monument to Pope Eugenius IV (reigned 1431&ndash;47), which was moved here when the old St Peter&rsquo;s was pulled down. An extravagant Venetian, Eugenius would willingly spend thousands of ducats on his gold tiara, but requested a &ldquo;simple, lowly burial place&rdquo; near his predecessor Pope Eugenius III. His portrait, painted by Salviati, hangs in the refectory. In 1669, San Salvatore in Lauro became the seat of a pious association, the Confraternity of the Piceni, who were inhabitants of the Marche region. Fanatically loyal to the pope, the Piceni were traditionally employed as papal soldiers and tax collectors.</p>","EWTG_ROME126SANSAL, TT_ROME086BESRES_010",Piazza di San Salvatore in Lauro 15,Rome,00186,Piazza Navona & Campo de’ Fiori,,Italy,06 687 5187,,,,,,,,,,,,www.sansalvatoreinlauro.com,,,,"70, 81, 87, 116, 186, 280, 492","4:30–7pm Mon–Sat, 8am–1pm & 4:30–7pm Sun",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,<p>Free entry</p>,EUR,41.900768,12.46933,TRUE,,FALSE,FALSE,Religious Buildings,places-of-worship,,,,,,,Festa di Padre Pio,Free,Religious Festivals,"<p>Each year on the anniversary of his death, Padre Pio is honored with celebrations and a procession leading from the church to Piazza Navona, with thousands of devotees participating.

According to legend, Agnes was exposed naked by order of Emperor Diocletian, furious that she should have rejected the advances of a young man at his court, but her hair miraculously grew to protect her modesty.</p><p>This church is said to have been built at the request of Emperor Constantine&rsquo;s daughter, Constantia, after she had prayed at the Tomb of St Agnes for delivery from leprosy. Though altered over the centuries, the form and much of the structure of the 4th-century basilica remain intact. In the sublime 7th-century apse mosaic, St Agnes appears as a bejewelled Byzantine empress in a stole of gold and a violet robe. According to tradition she appeared like this eight days after her death holding a white lamb. Every year on 21 January two lambs are blessed on the church altar and a vestment called the <em>pallium</em> is woven from their wool.

rome_sight_0892,,Sant’Agostino,"<p>The highlight of <strong>Sant&rsquo;Agostino</strong> is an elegant marble statue of the Madonna by the 15th-century Italian artist Jacopo Sansovino, which looks like a Roman goddess; indeed, it may have been inspired by a statue of Juno. Known as the <em>Madonna del Parto</em> (Madonna of Childbirth), the statue is surrounded by photographs of babies, children&rsquo;s drawings and embroidered hearts &ndash; gifts from those whose prayers to the Madonna for a child were answered. To one side is a book in which people from all over the world have written their prayers.</p><p>The church also displays Caravaggio&rsquo;s <em>Madonna dei Pellegrini</em> (Madonna of the Pilgrims). The sculpture shows a pair of scandalously scruffy pilgrims, with the filthy soles of their feet in full view, kneeling before the Madonna, who stands barefoot in the doorway of a house with a flaking wall, holding her overly large Christ child.

rome_sight_0895,,Sant’Andrea al Quirinale,"<p>It is widely agreed that <strong>Sant&rsquo;Andrea al Quirinale</strong> represents Bernini&rsquo;s architectural peak &ndash; it was, after all, the only construction over which he was able to exercise total artistic control. The church, which was built between 1658 and 1670, has long been dubbed the &ldquo;Pearl of the Baroque&rdquo; because of its beautiful roseate marble interior. It was built for the Jesuits, hence the many IHS emblems (<em>Iesus Hominum Salvator</em> &ndash; Jesus Saviour of Mankind).</p><p>The church is oval in shape and set on its short axis so that the first thing people see upon entry is the high altar niche in which sculpted angels appear to be positioning a painting of the saint being crucified on his diagonal cross. Higher up is a statue of the saint floating on a cloud, as if he has just slipped through the gap in the broken pediment behind him, on his way to heaven. The eye is drawn around the theatrical space, which combines architecture, painting and sculpture to re-enact the martyrdom and subsequent journey to heaven of St Andrew. The impact of Sant&rsquo;Andrea al Quirinale is surprisingly grand, for so small a church.</p><p>The rooms of St Stanislas Kostka in the adjacent convent should not be missed. The quarters of the Jesuit novice, who died in 1568 aged 19, reflect not his own spartan taste, but the richer style of the 17th-century Jesuits. The Polish saint has been brilliantly immortalized in marble by Pierre Legros (1666&ndash;1719).</p>","EWTG_ROME161SANAND, EWFG_ROME159SANAL, TT_ROME132QUIVIA_009_R13",Via del Quirinale 29,Rome,00184,Piazza di Spagna & Trevi Fountain,,Italy,06 474 0807,,,,,,,,,,,,www.gesuitialquirinale.it,,Barberini,,"71, 116, 117",8:30am–noon & 2:30–7pm Tue–Sun,,Mon,TRUE,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,<p>Free entry</p>,EUR,41.9008,12.489088,TRUE,,FALSE,Religious Buildings,Religious Buildings,places-of-worship,Sant’Andrea al Quirinale Rome | Church of Saint Andrew’s Quirinal,"Sant’Andrea al Quirinale is a domed church in Rome that has long been dubbed the ""Pearl of Baroque"".

rome_sight_0899,,Sant’Andrea della Valle,"<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to take in at the Counter-Reformation giant <strong>Sant&rsquo;Andrea della Valle</strong>. People usually visit for one of three reasons. Firstly, to see, first hand, the setting of the first act of Puccini&rsquo;s opera Tosca. Secondly, to marvel at the curiously asymmetrical fa&ccedil;ade, which came about as a result of architect Carlo Rainaldi&rsquo;s incredibly artistic temperament. And thirdly, to be dazzled by the city&rsquo;s second-largest dome, built by Carlo Maderno in 1622&ndash;5 and covered on the inside with splendid frescoes by Domenichino and Lanfranco. Staring up at the ceiling frescoes, all the clouds will start to seem real, and the figures above them will seem to float out from the walls and hang suspended in three-dimensional space. This optical illusion was Lanfranco&rsquo;s creation; his rival, Domenichino, was so angry when he lost most of the commission that he tampered with the scaffolding erected in the dome, hoping that Lanfranco would fall and break his neck.</p><p>The church&rsquo;s interior is illuminated by golden light that filters through high windows, showing off the gilded interior. Here lie the two popes of the Sienese Piccolomini family: on the left of the central nave is the tomb of Pius II, the first Humanist pope (reigned 1458&ndash;64); Pope Pius III lies opposite &ndash; he reigned for less than a month in 1503.</p>","EWTG_ROME123SANAND, TT_ROME044CHURCH_010, TT_ROME098CAMDE_004, EWFG_ROME118SANDEL",Piazza Sant’Andrea della Valle,Rome,00186,Piazza Navona & Campo de’ Fiori,,Italy,06 686 1339,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"H, 40, 46, 62, 64, 70, 81, 87, 116, 186, 492, 628",7:30am–12:30pm & 4:30–7:30pm daily,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,<p>Free entry</p>,EUR,41.896392,12.47438,TRUE,,FALSE,FALSE,Religious Buildings,places-of-worship,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sant’Ignazio di Loyola, Gesù"

Though the church is now firmly embedded in Rome, its location once marked the northern edge of the city.</p><p>The church was completely rebuilt in the 17th century, partly by Borromini. His bell tower and dome, best viewed from the higher ground further up Via Capo le Case, are remarkable for the complex arrangement of concave and convex surfaces. The bell tower is particularly fanciful, with angel caryatids, flaming torches, and exaggerated scrolls like semi-folded hearts supporting a spiky crown.</p><p>In 1842, the Virgin Mary appeared in the church to a Jewish banker, who promptly converted to Christianity and became a missionary. Inside, the chapel of the Miraculous Madonna is the first thing you notice. The church is better known, however, for the angels that Borromini&rsquo;s rival, Bernini, carved for the Ponte Sant&rsquo;Angelo. Pope Clement IX declared they were too lovely to be exposed to the weather, so they remained with Bernini&rsquo;s family until 1729, when they were moved to the church.</p>",EWTG_ROME132SANAND,Via Sant’Andrea delle Fratte 1,Rome,00187,Piazza di Spagna & Trevi Fountain,,Italy,06 679 3191,,,,,,,,,,,,www.santandreadellefratte.it,,"Spagna, Barberini",,"116, 117","6:30am–12:30pm & 4–7pm Mon–Fri, 6:30am–12:30pm & 4–8pm Sat & Sun",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>Free entry</p>,EUR,41.903742,12.483937,TRUE,,FALSE,FALSE,Religious Buildings,places-of-worship,,,PIAZZA DI SPAGNA |,,,church_services |,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sant Agnese in Agone, San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane"

rome_sight_0910,catalogue,Sant’Eligio degli Orefici,"<p>As its name suggests, early 16th-century <strong>Sant&rsquo;Eligio degli Orefici</strong> was commissioned by a corporation of goldsmiths (orefici). The original design was by Raphael, who, like his master Bramante, had acquired a sense of the grandiose from the remains of Roman antiquity. The influence of some of Bramante&rsquo;s works, such as the choir of Santa Maria del Popolo, is evident in the simple way the arches and pilasters here define the structure of the walls. The cupola of Sant&rsquo; Eligio is attributed to Baldassarre Peruzzi, while the fa&ccedil;ade was added in the early 17th century by Flaminio Ponzio. Among the various 16th-century painters who decorated the interior was Taddeo Zuccari, who worked on Palazzo Farnese.</p>",EWTG_ROME148SANDEG,Via di Sant’Eligio 8A,Rome,00186,Piazza Navona & Campo de’ Fiori,,Italy,06 686 8260,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"23, 40, 46, 62, 64, 116, 280",9:30am–1pm Mon–Fri (ring bell first at Via di Sant’Eligio 7),Aug,"Sat, Sun",,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>Free entry</p>,EUR,41.8956507244827,12.4679607668647,TRUE,,FALSE,FALSE,Religious Buildings,places-of-worship,,,"Churches, Temples and Shrines | CAMPO DE’ FIORI |",,,church_services |,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Palazzo Farnese

rome_sight_0913,,Sant’Ignazio di Loyola,"<p>The Baroque <strong>Sant&rsquo;Ignazio di Loyola</strong> is at its loveliest in the evening, when its marble columns and pavements gleam, and its polished brass glints in the lamplight. The beautiful church was built by Pope Gregory XV in 1626 in honour of St Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Society of Jesus and the man who most embodied the zeal of the Counter-Reformation. Together with the Ges&ugrave; church, Sant&rsquo;Ignazio forms the centre of the Jesuit area in Rome.</p><p>When this church was finished in 1685, it still lacked a dome. So the master of trompe-l&rsquo;oeil, Andrea Pozzo, used his flawless technique to create the illusion of an airy dome on the flat circle of ceiling over the church&rsquo;s crossing; stand on the yellow marble disc for the full effect, then walk directly under the &ldquo;dome&rdquo; to see how skewed the painting actually is.</p><p>Sant&rsquo;Ignazio di Loyola has a Latin-cross plan, with an apse and many side chapels. It cannot be denied that its vast interior, lined with precious stones, marble, stucco and gilt, creates a distinct sense of theatre. The frescoes in the nave celebrate the missionary work done by the Jesuits all over the world, with four women representing Europe, Asia, America and Africa.</p>","EWFG_ROME125SANTIG, EWTG_ROME106SANDI, TT_ROME090PANTHE_005",Piazza di Sant’Ignazio,Rome,00186,Piazza Navona & Campo de’ Fiori,,Italy,06 679 4406,,,,,,,,,,,,www.chiesasantignazio.it,,,,"81, 116, 117, 492",7:30am–12:20pm & 3–7:20pm daily,,,TRUE,,,,TRUE,,Free guided tours,,0,0,0,,<p>Free entry</p>,EUR,41.899079,12.479749,TRUE,,FALSE,FALSE,Religious Buildings,places-of-worship,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gesù, Sant’Andrea della Valle"
rome_sight_0917,,Sant’Ivo alla Sapienza,"<p><strong>Sant&rsquo;Ivo alla Sapienza</strong> stands in the city&rsquo;s most gorgeous courtyard, part of the Palazzo della Sapienza, seat of the old University of Rome from the 15th century until 1935. Its crowning glory is the spiralling ellipse of the dome &ndash; a highly distinctive landmark from Rome&rsquo;s roof terraces. The hexagonal church is based on a ground design of astonishing geometrical complexity, and the walls are a breathtaking combination of concave and convex surfaces. There is also a scalloped cupola. Sant&rsquo;Ivo is one of the most ingenious of the churches built by the 17th-century architect Francesco Borromini, though it must be said that the interior disappoints, despite its flower shape and the Pietro da Cortona altarpiece. In the courtyard, Borromini incorporated elements from the coats of arms of six popes. Look for bees (Pope Urban VIII Barberini), doves with olive branches in their beaks (Pope Innocent X Pamphilj), a star and jelly-mould (Pope Alexander VI Chigi), dragon (Pope Gregory VIII Buoncampagni), dragon and eagle (Pope Paul VI Borghese) and a lion holding some pears (Pope V Montalto).

The simple shapes of the portico and the cloister retain the flavour of the 15th century. In the early 17th century the portico was decorated with frescoes by Domenichino.

rome_sight_0921,catalogue,Santa Balbina,"<p>One of Rome&rsquo;s oldest churches, <strong>Santa Balbina</strong> was built in the 5th century on the remains of a Roman villa overlooking the Baths of Caracalla. The isolated church, which is dedicated to a 2nd-century virgin martyr, served as a fortified monastery in the Middle Ages. Over time it has changed in appearance several times, regaining its Romanesque aspect in the 1920s. From the piazza in front of the church, a staircase leads up to a three-arched portico. Inside, light streams in from a series of high windows along the length of the nave. The remains of St Balbina and her father, St Quirinus, are in an urn at the high altar, though the church&rsquo;s real treasure is situated in the far right-hand corner: the magnificent sculpted and inlaid tomb of Cardinal Stefanis de Surdis by Giovanni di Cosma (1303). Other features worth seeing are a 13th-century episcopal throne and various fragments of frescoes. These include a lovely <em>Madonna and Child</em>, an example of the school of Pietro Cavallini, in the second chapel on the left. Fragments of 1st-century Roman mosaics were discovered in the 1930s.

rome_sight_0922,catalogue,Santa Bibiana,"<p><strong>Santa Bibiana</strong> was Bernini&rsquo;s first attempt at building design, as its clean lines and unadorned fa&ccedil;ade suggest. The church was built on the site of the palace belonging to Bibiana&rsquo;s family, and it is where the saint was buried after she was flogged to death with leaded cords during the brief persecution of the Christians in the reign of Julian the Apostate (361&ndash;3). Just inside the church is a small column against which Bibiana is said to have been whipped. Her remains, along with those of her mother, Dafrosa, and her sister, Demetria, who also suffered martyrdom, are preserved in an alabaster urn below the altar. In a niche above the altar stands a statue of Santa Bibiana by Bernini &ndash; the first fully clothed figure he sculpted. He depicts her standing beside a column, holding the cords with which she was whipped, apparently on the verge of a deadly swoon.</p>",EWTG_ROME174SANBIB,Via Giovanni Giolitti 154,Rome,00185,Esquiline & Lateran,,Italy,06 446 5235,,,,,,,,,,,,www.santabibiana.com,"Termini Laziali, S.

rome_sight_0923,,Santa Cecilia in Trastevere,"<p>It is said that <strong>Santa Cecilia in Trastevere</strong> was built over the house of the martyred aristocrat and patron saint of music who gives the church its name. After an attempt to suffocate Cecilia to death failed, she was beheaded here in AD 230. Her body was lost but it turned up in the Catacombs of San Callisto and was buried here in the 9th century by Pope Paschal I, who also rebuilt the church.</p><p>A fine apse mosaic survives from this period. The altar canopy by Arnolfo di Cambio and the fresco of <em>The Last Judgment</em> by Pietro Cavallini, reached through the adjoining convent, date from the 13th century, one of the few periods when Rome had a distinctive artistic style of its own. In front of the altar is a statue of St Cecilia by Stefano Maderno, who used sketches of her miraculously preserved remains as a model when she was briefly disinterred in 1599. Her house, beneath the church with the remains of a Roman tannery, is well worth a visit.</p>","EWTG_ROME211SANCEC, TT_ROME138TRAPRA_005_R13",Piazza di Santa Cecilia,Rome,00153,Trastevere & Janiculum Hill,,Italy,06 589 9289,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"H, 23, 44, 125, 280",9:30am–1pm & 4–6:30pm daily,,,,,,,,,,for excavations. |,2.50,2.50,2.50,,<p>Adults &euro;2.50</p><p>Concessions &euro;2.50</p><p>Children &euro;2.50</p><p></p>,EUR,41.887658,12.475662,TRUE,,FALSE,Religious Buildings,Religious Buildings,places-of-worship,Santa Cecilia in Trastevere | Visit Santa Cecilia Church Rome,Santa Cecilia in Trastevere is a church in Rome said to be built over the house of Saint Cecilia.

rome_sight_0926,catalogue,Santa Costanza,"<p>The smooth, round <strong>Santa Costanza</strong> has a very distinctive look in a city of angular churches and tall spires. It was built in the 4th century as a mausoleum for Emperor Constantine&rsquo;s daughters, Constantia and Helena. The dome and its drum are supported by a circular arcade resting on 12 pairs of magnificent granite columns. The ambulatory around the interior has truly delightful, richly detailed scenes of an ancient Roman grape harvest. In a niche on the side of the church furthest from the entrance is a replica of Constantia&rsquo;s ornately carved porphyry sarcophagus. The original was moved to the Vatican Museums in 1790. The sanctity of Constantia is debatable &ndash; she was described by the historian Marcellinus as a fury incarnate, constantly goading her equally unpleasant husband, Hannibalianus, to violence. Her canonization was probably the result of some confusion with a saintly nun of the same name.</p>","EWTG_ROME264SANCOS, TT_ROME150BEYCIT_010",Via Nomentana 349,Rome,00162,Beyond the Centre,,Italy,06 8620 5456,,,,,,,,,,,,,,S.agnese/annibaliano,,"36, 60, 84, 90",9am–noon & 4–6pm Mon–Sat,,Sun,TRUE,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,<p>Free entry</p>,EUR,41.922337,12.518591,TRUE,,FALSE,FALSE,Religious Buildings,places-of-worship,,,FURTHER AFIELD |,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rome_sight_0927,catalogue,Santa Croce in Gerusalemme,"<p><strong>Santa Croce in Gerusalemme</strong> was founded in AD 320 in the grounds of the private palace of Emperor Constantine&rsquo;s mother, St Helena. Although the church stood at the edge of the city, the relics of the Crucifixion that St Helena had brought back from Jerusalem made it a centre of pilgrimage. Most important were the pieces of Christ&rsquo;s Cross (<em>croce</em> means cross) and part of Pontius Pilate&rsquo;s inscription in Latin, Hebrew and Greek reading: &ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth King of the Jews&rdquo;. In the crypt is a Roman statue of Juno, found at Ostia, transformed into a statue of St Helena by replacing the head and arms and adding a cross. The 15th-century apse fresco shows the medieval legends that arose around the Cross. Helena is shown holding it over a dead youth and restoring him to life. Another episode shows its recovery from the Persians by the Byzantine Emperor Heraclitus after a bloody battle. In the centre of the apse is a magnificent tomb by Jacopo Sansovino made for Cardinal Qui&ntilde;ones, Emperor Charles V&rsquo;s confessor (died 1540).</p>",EWTG_ROME181SANCRO,Piazza di Santa Croce in Gerusalemme 12,Rome,00141,Esquiline & Lateran,,Italy,06 7061 3053,,,,,,,,,,,,www.santacroceroma.it,Porta Maggiore,,Piazza Santa Croce In Gerusalemme,"16, 81, 649, 810",7am–12:45pm & 3:30–7:30pm daily,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,0,0,0,,<p>Free entry</p>,EUR,41.888337,12.515621,TRUE,,FALSE,Religious Buildings,Religious Buildings,places-of-worship,Santa Croce Gerusalemme | Santa Croce Rome,Santa Croce in Gerusalemme is a church in Rome that was founded in AD 320.

rome_sight_0932,,Santa Maria dei Miracoli and Santa Maria in Montesanto,"<p><strong>Santa Maria dei Miracoli</strong> and <strong>Santa Maria in Montesanto</strong>, a pair of 17th-century churches at the southern end of Piazza del Popolo, are known for the optical illusion that was so central to their design. To provide a focal point for the piazza, the churches had to appear symmetrical, but the site on the left was narrower. Local architect Carlo Rainaldi (1611&ndash;91) decided to give Santa Maria dei Miracoli (on the right) a circular dome and Santa Maria in Montesanto an oval one to squeeze it into the narrower site, while keeping the sides of the supporting drums that face the piazza identical. The clever design gives creates the illusion that the three streets cutting down through the centro storico, known as &ldquo;Il Tridente&ldquo;, form a perfect triangle, when they actually do not. A great feat of design, the twin churches proved beyond doubt that Rainaldi could be as ingenious as his peers, Bernini and Borromini. Stand in the centre of the piazza, in front of the obelisk, to judge this visual trick.</p>","EWTG_ROME136SANMAR, TT_ROME112BESRES_005_R13, EWFG_ROME150SANMAR, TT_ROME112BESRES_031_R13, TT_ROME112BESRES_029_R13, EWTG_ROME136SANMAR_003, EWTG_ROME136SANMAR_004",Piazza del Popolo,Rome,00187,Piazza di Spagna & Trevi Fountain,,Italy,,Montesanto,06 361 0594,,Miracoli, 06 361 0250,,,,,,,www.chiesadegliartisti.it,Flaminio,Flaminio,,"61, 95, 117, 119, 120, 150, 160, 490, 491, 495, 628, 926"," <p><strong>Miracoli</strong>: 7am–12:30pm & 4–7:30pm daily</p><p><strong>Montesanto</strong>: 5–8pm Mon–Fri, 10:3am–1:30pm Sun</p>",,,TRUE,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,<p>Free entry</p>,EUR,41.9097488592556,12.4768430739641,TRUE,,FALSE,FALSE,Religious Buildings,places-of-worship,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was reconstructed between 1583 and 1600 by Martino Longhi, who provided the early Baroque fa&ccedil;ade.

rome_sight_0954,,Santa Maria della Pace,"<p><strong>Santa Maria della Pace</strong> was one of the most fashionable churches in Renaissance Rome, frequented by artists, aristocrats and bankers, as well as by women who considered going to Mass a great opportunity to show off their best clothes and find wealthy husbands and admirers.</p><p>The church was built to mark the site where a drunken soldier allegedly pierced the breast of a painted Madonna, and caused it to bleed. Pope Sixtus IV della Rovere (reigned 1471&ndash;84) placated the Virgin by ordering Baccio Pontelli to build her a church if she would bring the war with Turkey to an end. Peace was restored and the church was named St Mary of Peace.</p><p>The church&rsquo;s lovely and surprising fa&ccedil;ade (1656&ndash;7), its curved portico squeezed into a tiny piazza, is a Baroque masterpiece by Pietro da Cortona. The cloister was added by Bramante in 1504. As in his famous Tempietto, he scrupulously followed Classical rules of proportion and achieved a monumental effect in a relatively small space. Pietro da Cortona may also have had Bramante&rsquo;s Tempietto in mind when he added the church&rsquo;s charming semi-circular portico in 1656.</p><p>The church&rsquo;s interior, a short nave ending under an octagonal cupola, houses Raphael&rsquo;s famous frescoes of four <em>Sybils</em> (1514), which were influenced by the then recently unveiled Sistine Chapel ceiling. The Sibyls range from a beautiful young blonde woman to a very old lady, each receiving a revelation from an angel. They are best seen from Bramante&rsquo;s cloister. The four <em>Prophets</em> by Raphael&rsquo;s pupil Timoteo Viti, painted for the banker Agostino Chigi in 1514, are also on display here. Baldassarre Peruzzi also did some work in the church (the fresco in the first chapel on the left), as did the architect Antonio da Sangallo the Younger, who designed the second chapel on the right.</p>","EWTG_ROME121SANMA1, TT_ROME082PIANAV_006_R13, EWFG_ROME120SANMAR",Vicolo dell’Arco della Pace 5,Rome,00186,Piazza Navona & Campo de’ Fiori,,Italy,06 686 1156,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"C3, 30, 46, 62, 64, 70, 81, 87, 116, 130, 186, 492, 628","9–11:50am Mon, Wed, Sat",,"Tue, Thu, Fri, Sun",TRUE,2 steps,,,,,,,0,0,0,,<p>Free entry</p>,EUR,41.8997379281592,12.4718202994404,TRUE,,FALSE,FALSE,Religious Buildings,places-of-worship,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Villa Farnesina, Tempietto, Vatican Museums, Palazzo Barberini"

rome_sight_0961,,Santa Maria della Vittoria,"<p>Boasting one of the most ornate church interiors in Rome, the 17th-century <strong>Santa Maria della Vittoria</strong> really is an unmissable sight. The intimate, candlelit space, which is caked in stucco, coloured marbles and gold, is mainly the work of Bernini and his students. It contains one of Bernini&rsquo;s most ambitious sculptural works, <em>The Ecstasy of St Teresa</em> (1646), centrepiece of the Cornaro Chapel, which was built to resemble a miniature theatre. It even has an audience: sculptures of the chapel&rsquo;s benefactor, Cardinal Federico Cornaro, and his ecclesiastical family members, past and present, sit in boxes, as if watching and discussing the scene occurring in front of them. Visitors may be shocked or thrilled by the physical nature of St Teresa&rsquo;s ecstasy. She lies on a cloud, her mouth half open and her eyelids closed, with rippling drapery covering her body. Looking over her with a smile, which from different angles can appear either tender or cruel, is a curly-haired angel holding an arrow with which he is about to pierce the saint&rsquo;s body for a second time.

Its 22 columns were taken from various ancient buildings; the inscription on the third column to the left tells us that it comes &ldquo;<em>a cubiculo Augustorum</em>&rdquo; &ndash; from the bedroom of the emperors.</p><p>The church of the Roman senators and people, Santa Maria in Aracoeli has been used to celebrate many triumphs over adversity. Its ceiling, with naval motifs, commemorates the Battle of Lepanto (1571), and was built under Pope Gregory XIII Boncompagni, whose family crest, the dragon, can be seen towards the altar end. Many other Roman families and individuals are honoured by memorials in the church. To the right of the entrance door, the tombstone of archdeacon Giovanni Crivelli, rather than being set into the floor of the church, stands eternally to attention, partly so that the signature &ldquo;Donatelli&rdquo; (by Donatello) can be read at eye-level.</p><p>The frescoes in the first chapel on the right, painted by Pinturicchio in the 1480s in the beautifully clear style of the Early Renaissance, depict St Bernardino of Siena. On the left wall, the perspective of <em>The Burial of the Saint</em> slants to the right, taking into account the position of the viewer just outside the chapel. The church is most famous, however, for an icon with apparently miraculous powers, the <em>Santo Bambino</em>, a 15th-century olive-wood figure of the Christ Child that was carved from wood taken from a tree in the garden of Gethsemane. Its powers are said to include resurrecting the dead, and it is sometimes summoned to the bedsides of the gravely ill. The original figure was stolen in 1994, but it has been replaced by a replica. At Christmas, the Christ Child takes its place in the centre of a picturesque crib (second chapel to the left), but is usually to be found in the sacristy, as is the panel of the Holy Family from the workshop of Giulio Romano.</p>","EWTG_ROME069SANMAR, TT_ROME098CAMDE_008",Scala dell’Arce Capitolina 14,Rome,00186,Ancient Rome,,Italy,06 6976 3839,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"46, 60, 80B, 190F, 780, 916, 916F, N3, N4, N6, N12, N18, N19, N20, N25",Summer: 9am–6:30pm; winter: 9:30am–5:30pm,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,<p>Free entry</p>,EUR,41.893778,12.481887,TRUE,,FALSE,FALSE,Religious Buildings,places-of-worship,,,,,,,Procession of the Santo Bambino,Free,Religious Festivals,"<p>Hundreds of people climb the 124 steps up to the church as bagpipers play traditional medieval tunes.

rome_sight_0991,,Santa Maria sopra Minerva,"<p>The only Florentine Gothic church in Rome, <strong>Santa Maria sopra Minerva</strong> was built in around 1280, possibly &ndash; as its name suggests &ndash; atop a temple to Minerva. The simple T-shaped, vaulted building is celebrated for its impressive collection of Italian art, largely acquired from its wealthy patrons, who wished to be remembered by their gifts.</p><p>Near the steps of the choir is the beloved sculpture of the <em>Risen Christ</em> (1514&ndash;21), a muscular rendition of the Saviour so shockingly nude that Church officials added the bronze wisp of drapery. Note the Cosmatesque 13th-century tombs and the exquisite works by 15th-century Tuscan and Venetian artists. Local talent of the Early Renaissance period is represented by Antoniazzo Romano, whose <em>Annunciation </em>(1482), features the uncle of the infamous Spanish Inquisitor, Cardinal Juan de Torquemada. The more monumental style of the Roman Renaissance is well represented in the tombs of the 16th-century Medici popes, Leo X and his cousin Clement VII. The church contains the tombs of other famous Italians: St Catherine of Siena, who died here in 1380; the Venetian sculptor Andrea Bregno (died 1506); the Humanist Cardinal Pietro Bembo (died 1547); and Fra Angelico, the Dominican friar and painter, who died in Rome in 1455. There are also splendid works of art from the Baroque period, including a tomb and a bust by Bernini.</p><p>Santa Maria sopra Minerva was the traditional stronghold of the Dominicans, whose anti-heretical zeal earned them the nickname <em>Domini Canes</em> (the hounds of the Lord).</p>","EWTG_ROME108SANMAR, TT_ROME044CHURCH_005, TT_ROME090PANTHE_002",Piazza della Minerva 42,Rome,00186,Piazza Navona & Campo de’ Fiori,,Italy,06 679 3926,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,116,"7:10am–7pm Mon–Sat, 8am–noon & 2–7pm Sun",,,TRUE,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,<p>Free entry</p>,EUR,41.897993,12.477918,TRUE,,FALSE,FALSE,Religious Buildings,places-of-worship,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,St Peter’s

The church, which was founded by Pope Paschal II and built over a 2nd-century oratory, features three aisles separated by rows of granite columns. In the central nave, there is a round stone slab covering the well where, according to legend, St Prassede is said to have buried the remains of 2,000 martyrs. Artists from Byzantium decorated the church with glittering, jewel-coloured mosaics. Those in the apse and choir depict stylized white-robed elders, the haloed elect looking down from the gold and blue walls of heaven, spindly legged lambs, feather-mop palm trees and bright red poppies.</p><p>In the apse, Santa Prassede and Santa Pudenziana stand on either side of Christ, with the fatherly arms of St Paul and St Peter on their shoulders. Beautiful mosaics of saints, the Virgin, and Christ and the Apostles also cover the walls and vault of the Chapel of St Zeno, built as a mausoleum for Pope Paschal&rsquo;s mother, Theodora.

In the 2nd century, a bath house was built here and in the 4th century, a church, known as the Ecclesia Pudentiana (the church of Pudens), was established inside the baths. In time it was assumed that &ldquo;Pudentiana&rdquo; was a woman&rsquo;s name and a life was created for her &ndash; she became the sister of Prassede and was credited with caring for Christian victims of persecution. In 1969, both saints were declared invalid, though their churches both kept their names.</p><p>The 19th-century fa&ccedil;ade of the church retains an 11th-century frieze depicting both Prassede and Pudenziana dressed as crowned Byzantine empresses. The apse has a remarkable 4th-century mosaic, clearly influenced by Classical pagan art in its subtle use of colour.

The archway in the centre may have been added during this period. In the 16th century, the church&rsquo;s walls were frescoed by Niccol&ograve; Pomarancio, with particularly gruesome illustrations of the martyrdom of innumerable saints.

rome_sight_1027,catalogue,Scala Santa and Sancta Sanctorum,"<p><strong>Scala Santa</strong> and <strong>Sancta Sanctorum</strong>, two surviving parts of the old Lateran Palace, are today located in a building designed by Domenico Fontana (1589) on the east side of Piazza di San Giovanni in Laterano.</p><p>One is the holy staircase, the Scala Santa. The 28 steps, said to be those that Christ ascended in Pontius Pilate&rsquo;s house during his trial, are thought to have been brought from Jerusalem by St Helena, mother of Emperor Constantine. This belief, however, cannot be traced back any earlier than the 7th century. The steps were moved to their present site by Pope Sixtus V (reigned 1585&ndash;90) when the old Lateran Palace was destroyed. No foot may touch the holy steps, so they are covered by wooden boards. They may only be climbed by the faithful on their knees, a penance that is performed especially on Good Friday. In the vestibule there are various 19th-century sculptures, including an <em>Ecce Homo</em> by Giosu&egrave; Meli (1874).</p><p>The Scala Santa and two side stairways lead to the Chapel of St Lawrence, or Sancta Sanctorum (Holy of Holies), built by Pope Nicholas III in 1278. Decorated with fine Cosmatesque marble-work, the chapel contains many important relics, the most precious being an image of Jesus &ndash; the <em>Acheiropoeton</em>, or &ldquo;picture painted without hands&rdquo; &ndash; said to be the work of St Luke, with the help of an angel. In medieval times, it was taken on procession to ward off the plague.</p><p>On the walls and in the vault, restoration work has revealed 13th-century frescoes, which, for 500 years, had been covered by later paintings. The frescoes, representing the legends of St Nicholas, St Lawrence, St Agnes and St Paul, show signs of the style that would characterize the frescoes of Giotto in Assisi, made a few years later.</p>",EWTG_ROME180SCASAN,Piazza di San Giovanni in Laterano 14,Rome,00184,Esquiline & Lateran,,Italy,06 772 6641,,,,,,,,,,,,,,San Giovanni,Porta San Giovanni-Carlo Felice,"16, 81, 85, 87, 186","6am–12:30pm, 3–6:30pm daily",,,,,,,,,,,3.5,3.5,0,,<p>Adults &euro;3.50</p><p>Concessions &euro;3.50</p><p>Children free</p><p></p>,EUR,41.887147,12.506737,TRUE,,FALSE,FALSE,"Religious Buildings, Historic Sights and Landmarks",places-of-worship,,,LATERAN |,,,transport - tram: 3. | church |,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,San Giovanni in Laterano

The earliest sarcophagus that was found in the Tomb of the Scipios was that of Cornelius Scipio Barbatus, consul in 298 BC, for whom the tomb was built. Members of his illustrious family continued to be buried here up to the middle of the 2nd century BC.

rome_sight_1109,,Trajan’s Column,"<p>Created in AD 113 to celebrate two victorious Roman campaigns in Dacia (present-day Romania), <strong>Trajan&rsquo;s Column</strong>, together with its base and pedestal, is 40 m (131 ft) high, precisely the height of the spur of the Quirinal Hill that was cut away to make room for Trajan&rsquo;s Forum. Considered to represent Roman sculptural art at its peak, the column is decorated with intricate carvings, spiralling upwards and telling the stories of the campaigns. They are so full of detail that some archaeologists think they may have been based on Trajan&rsquo;s own war diary. It is not just battles that are depicted, but the realities of life at war for both Romans and Dacians.</p><p>The Romans are shown arriving in Dacia with their supplies in boats, building a camp, cutting down trees, sinking wells and constructing huts. Battle scenes show the Dacians being attacked, as well as Dacian attacks on the Romans, and even the aftermath of a battle. After the first campaign, the Dacians continued to resist, before the Romans attacked a walled town and set fire to it. The carvings also show a Dacian priest distributing poison to those who prefered to die than be conquered. It is extremely difficult to see these scenes from the ground, which makes one wonder how the Romans would have been able to see it. Standing on the upper floor of the two libraries that flanked the column would have made some of the scenes visible, but there would still have been sections that were out of sight. Today, the best way to see the column in detail is to watch animated films in Palazzo Valentini or take the metro out to EUR in southern Rome to see casts at eye level.</p><p>Along with the intricate detail on the outside, the column is pierced with small windows to illuminate its internal spiral staircase (closed to the public). The column&rsquo;s survival was largely thanks to the intervention of Pope Gregory the Great (reigned 590&ndash;604). He was so moved by a relief showing Trajan helping a woman whose son had been killed that he begged God to release the emperor&rsquo;s soul from hell. God duly appeared to the pope to say that Trajan had been rescued, but asked him not to pray for the souls of any more pagans. According to legend, when Trajan&rsquo;s ashes were exhumed his skull and tongue were not only intact, but his tongue told of his release from hell. The land around the column was then declared sacred and the column itself was spared. The statue of Trajan remained on top of the column until 1587, when it was replaced with one of St Peter.</p>","EWTG_ROME090TRACOL, EWFG_ROME088TRACOL, TT_ROME118ANCROM_002, TT_ROME022COLIMP_004",Via dei Fori Imperiali,Rome,00187,Ancient Rome,,Italy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cavour, Colosseo",,"H, 40, 53, 60, 64, 70, 71, 80, 85, 87, 117, 170, 175, 186, 271, 571, 810",,,,TRUE,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,<p>Free entry</p>,EUR,41.895827,12.484264,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,Ancient Ruins,famous-landmarks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Palazzo Valentini

rome_sight_1137,,Trinità dei Monti,"<p>Crowning the French-commissioned Spanish Steps, <strong>Trinit&agrave; dei Monti</strong> was part of a convent founded by Louis XII in 1503, but the views of Rome from the platform in front of the twin bell-towered fa&ccedil;ade are so beautiful that the church itself is often ignored. It is, however, unusual for Rome, for it was founded by the French in 1495, and although it was later badly damaged, there are still traces of attractive late Gothic latticework in the vaults of the transept. The twin-towered fa&ccedil;ade (1584) is by Giacomo della Porta; the double staircase (1587) by Domenico Fontana. The Baroque interior has three chapels. The interconnecting side chapels are decorated with Mannerist paintings, including two fine works by Daniele da Volterra. A pupil of Michelangelo, Volterra had to paint clothes on the nudes in the <em>Last Judgment</em> in the Sistine Chapel, in response to the objections of Pope Pius IV, earning the artist the nickname &ldquo;Il Braghettone&rdquo; (the breeches-maker). Michelangelo&rsquo;s influence is obvious in the powerfully muscled bodies shown in the <em>Deposition</em> (second chapel on the left). The circles of gesturing figures and dancing angels surrounding the Virgin Mary in the <em>Assumption</em> (third chapel on the right) include a portrait of his teacher Michelangelo as the far right figure, but this painting actually has more in common with the graceful style of Raphael.</p>","EWTG_ROME135TRIDEI, TT_ROME108SPASTE_008, EWFG_ROME145TRIDEI",Piazza della Trinità dei Monti,Rome,00187,Piazza di Spagna & Trevi Fountain,,Italy,06 679 4179,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Spagna,,"116, 117, 119, 590","6:30am–8pm Tue, Wed, Fri, Sat, 6:30am–midnight Thu",,"Mon, Sun",,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>Free entry</p>,EUR,41.9062035642471,12.4833239614963,TRUE,,FALSE,FALSE,Religious Buildings,places-of-worship,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish Steps, Piazza di Spagna, Vatican Museums"

Most of the later additions to the buildings were made in the 18th century, when priceless works of art were first put on show. The Vatican also houses many of the great archaeological finds of central Italy, including the <em>Laoco&ouml;n </em>group, the <em>Apollo del Belvedere </em>and the Etruscan bronze known as the <em>Mars of Todi</em>. This complex of museums houses the Sistine Chapel and the Raphael Rooms, which should not be missed.</p><h2><strong>Sistine Chapel</strong></h2><p>The walls of the Sistine Chapel, the main chapel in the Vatican Palace, were frescoed by some of the finest artists of the 15th and 16th centuries. The 12 paintings on the side walls, by artists including Perugino, Ghirlandaio, Botticelli and Signorelli, show parallel episodes from the lives of Moses and Christ. Restored in the 1980s, Michelangelo&rsquo;s stunning ceiling fresco (1508&ndash;12) contains 366 figures, illustrating the biblical stories of the Creation of the World, the Fall of Man and the Coming of Christ.</p><h2><strong>Raphael Rooms</strong></h2><p>Pope Julius II&rsquo;s private apartments were built above those of his hated predecessor, Alexander VI, who died in 1503. Julius was impressed with Raphael’s work and chose him to redecorate the four rooms. Raphael and his pupils began the task in 1508, replacing existing works by several better-known artists, including Raphael&rsquo;s teacher, Perugino. The frescoes, which took over 16 years to complete, express the religious and philosophical ideas of the Renaissance. They quickly established Raphael&rsquo;s reputation as an artist in Rome, putting him on a par with Michelangelo.</p>","EWTG_ROME234VATMUS, TT_ROME042MUSGAL_001, EWFG_ROME206VATMUS",Viale Vaticano,Rome,00165,The Vatican,,Italy, 06 6988 4676,,,,,,,,,,,,www.museivaticani.va,Valle Aurelia,"Ottaviano, Cipro",Risorgimento-San Pietro,"23, 49, 62, 81, 492, 990","<p>9am–6pm (last admission 4pm) Mon–Sat</p><p>9am–2pm (last admission 12:30pm) last Sun of each month free entrance unless it coincides with Easter Sun, 29 Jun, 25 & 26 Dec</p>",,"Sun, 1 & 6 Jan, 11 Feb, 19 & 31 Mar, 1 Apr, 1 May, 29 Jun, 14 & 15 Aug, 1 Nov, 25 & 26 Dec",TRUE,Special routes,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"Full: €32, reduced: €24 (6–18 years, students under 26); the ticket includes: admission to the Museums, guided tour and rental of audio-guides",(free last Sun of month). |,16,8,8,"Under 6s free, last Sun of each month free","<p>Adults &euro;16.00</p><p>Concessions &euro;8.00</p><p>Children &euro;8.00</p><p>Under 6s free, last Sun of each month free</p>",EUR,41.906433,12.453581,TRUE,,TRUE,Art Galleries and Museums,"Art Galleries and Museums, Religious Buildings, Historic Sights and Landmarks",museums,Vatican Museum Rome | Visit Vatican Museums,"The Vatican Museum contains one of the world’s great art collections, as well as the Sistine Chapel.

Its most famous prisoner was scientist Galileo Galilei, who is remembered in an inscription on a column just beyond the villa. Today, the villa is home to the French Academy, founded by Louis XIV in 1666 to give a few select painters the chance to study in Rome. Nicolas Poussin was one of the first advisers to the Academy, Ingres was a director and ex-students include Jean-Honor&eacute; Fragonard and Fran&ccedil;ois Boucher. After 1803, when the French Academy moved to the Villa Medici, musicians were also admitted; both Berlioz and Debussy came to Rome as students of the Academy.</p><p><br />The highlight of the villa is the Stanza degli Uccelli, a pavilion in the garden frescoed with birds, flowers, fruit and trees.

rome_sight_1289,,Tivoli,"<p>Located 48 km (30 miles) outside of Rome,&nbsp;<strong>Tivoli</strong> has been a popular summer resort since the days of the Roman Republic. Among the famous men who owned villas here were the poets Catullus and Horace, Caesar&rsquo;s assassins Brutus and Cassius, and the Emperors Trajan and Hadrian. Tivoli&rsquo;s main attractions were its clean air and beautiful situation on the slopes of the Tiburtini hills, its healthy sulphur springs and the waterfalls of the Aniene &ndash; the Emperor Augustus said these had cured him of insomnia. The Romans&rsquo; luxurious lifestyle was revived in Renaissance times by the owners of the Villa d&rsquo;Este, the town&rsquo;s most famous sight.</p><p>In the Middle Ages Tivoli suffered frequent invasions as its position made it an ideal base for an advance on Rome. In 1461 Pope Pius II built a fortress here, the Rocca Pia, declaring: &ldquo;It is easier to regain Rome while possessing Tivoli, than to regain Tivoli while possessing Rome.&rdquo;</p><p>After suffering heavy bomb-damage in 1944, Tivoli&rsquo;s main buildings and churches were speedily restored. The town&rsquo;s cobbled streets are still lined with medieval houses. The Duomo (cathedral) houses a beautiful 13th-century life-size wooden group representing the <em>Deposition from the Cross</em>. Tivoli makes a good place to stop either before or after visiting Hadrian&rsquo;s Villa.</p>",,,Rome,00019,Further Afield,,Italy,,,,,,,,,,,,,www.duomoditivoli.it,Tivoli,,,,"Church services: 7:30am, 10am & 5:30pm",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,EUR,41.960103,12.799794,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,Historic Sights and Landmarks,famous-landmarks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hadrian’s Villa

Other fountains are now being restored to their former glory. The Fontana dell&rsquo;Organo is a water-organ, in which the force of the water pumps air through the pipes.

rome_sight_1291,,Hadrian’s Villa,"<p>Shaded by pines and beautifully set in the countryside, <strong>Hadrian&rsquo;s Villa</strong> was built by the emperor in AD 128 as a magnificent private retreat, with bath houses, libraries, a fire station, temples and theatres as well as a palace. Hadrian had been very impressed with the buildings he had seen during his travels in Greece and Egypt and had a few of them reproduced here, creating a vast open-air museum of the finest architecture of the Roman world. Today, the villa is a wonderful place for a peaceful day out, with plenty of space to relax and enjoy picnics and games.</p><p>Excavations on the 120 hectare (300 acre)&nbsp;site began in the 16th century, though many of the ruins lying scattered in the surrounding fields have yet to be identified with any certainty.&nbsp;For an idea of how the whole complex would have looked in its heyday, study the scale model in the building beside the car park. The most important buildings are signposted and several have been partially restored or reconstructed. One of the most impressive is the so-called Maritime Theatre. This is a round pool with an island in the middle, surrounded by columns. The island, reached by means of a swing bridge, was probably Hadrian&rsquo;s private studio, where he withdrew from the cares of the Empire to indulge in his two favourite pastimes, painting and architecture. There were also theatres, Greek and Latin libraries, two bathhouses, extensive housing for guests and the palace staff, and formal gardens with fountains, statues and pools.</p><p>Hadrian also loved Greek philosophy. One part of the gardens is thought to have been Hadrian&rsquo;s reproduction of the Grove of Academe, where Plato lectured to his students. He also had a replica made of the Sto&agrave; Poikile, a beautiful painted colonnade in Athens, from which the Stoic philosophers took their name. This copy enclosed a great piazza with a central pool. The so-called Hall of the Philosophers close to the Poikile was probably a library.</p><p>The most ambitious of Hadrian&rsquo;s replicas was the Canopus, a sanctuary of the god Serapis near Alexandria. For this a canal 119 metres (130 yards) long was dug and Egyptian statues were imported to decorate the temple and its grounds. This impressive piece of engineering has been restored and the banks of the canal are lined with caryatids.</p><p>Another picturesque spot in the grounds is the Vale of Tempe, the legendary haunt of the goddess Diana with a stream representing the river Peneios. Below ground the emperor even built a fanciful re-creation of the underworld, Hades, reached through underground tunnels, of which there were many linking the various parts of the villa.</p><p>Plundered by barbarians who camped here in the 6th and 8th centuries, the villa fell into disrepair. Its marble was burned to make lime for cement and Renaissance antiquarians contributed even further to its destruction. Statues unearthed in the grounds are on show in museums around Europe. The Vatican&rsquo;s Egyptian Collection has many fine works that were found here.</p>",,Largo Marguerite Yourcenar 1,Rome,00010,Further Afield,,Italy,077 4530 203,,,,,,,,,,,,www.villaadriana.beniculturali.it,,,,"COTRAL bus from Ponte Mammolo, CAT 4 from Tivoli",<p>Nov–Jan: 9am–5pm daily; Feb: 9am–6pm daily; Mar & Oct: 9am–6:30pm</p><p>Apr–Sep: 9am–7pm daily; May–Aug: 9am–7:30pm daily</p>,,"1 Jan, 1 May, 25 Dec",TRUE,Partial,,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"Audio guides in Italian, English, French, German and Spanish",,34,24,24,EU under 18s free; under 6s free,,EUR,41.946032,12.772801,TRUE,,FALSE,FALSE,"Ancient Ruins, Historic Sights and Landmarks",famous-landmarks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ostia Antica
rome_sight_1292,,Ostia Antica,"<p>The remains of an ancient port,&nbsp;<strong>Ostia Antica</strong>&nbsp;is one of the&nbsp;most extensive and evocative Roman sites in Italy.&nbsp;The city was originally built on the coast but, over the centuries, the Tiber shifted course further west and Ostia now lies stranded quite a distance from the sea.&nbsp;Buried for centuries by sand, the city is remarkably well preserved. The site is less spectacular than Pompeii or Herculaneum because Ostia died a gradual death, but it gives a more complete picture of life under the Roman Empire.</p><p>Ostia was founded in the 4th century BC, first as a simple fort, but as Rome grew, the town became ever more important, as the distribution point for imports from around the Mediterranean.&nbsp;The port continued to flourish under the Empire, despite the development of Portus, a new port slightly to the northwest, in the 2nd century AD. Ostia&rsquo;s decline began in the 4th century, when a reduction in trade was combined with the gradual silting up of the harbour. Then malaria became endemic in the area and the city, whose population may have been nearly 100,000 at its peak, was totally abandoned.&nbsp;</p><p>Visitors can understand the layout of Ostia&rsquo;s streets almost at a glance. The main road through the town, the Decumanus Maximus, would have been filled with hurrying slaves and citizens, avoiding the jostling carriages and carts, while tradesmen pursued their business under the porticoes lining the street. The floorplans of the public buildings along the road are very clear. Many were bathhouses, such as the Baths of the Cisiarii (carters) and the grander Baths of Neptune, named after their fine black-and-white floor mosaics. Beside the theatre, three large masks, originally part of the decoration of the stage, have been mounted on large blocks of tufa. Beneath the great brick arches that supported the semicircular tiers of seats were taverns and shops. Classical plays are put on here in the summer.</p><p>The Tiber&rsquo;s course has changed considerably since Ostia was the port of Rome. It once flowed past just to the north of Piazzale delle Corporazioni, the square behind the theatre. The corporations were the guilds of the various trades involved in fitting out and supplying ships: tanners and rope-makers, ship-builders and timber merchants, ships&rsquo; chandlers and corn weighers. There were some 60 or 70 offices around the square. Mosaics showing scenes of everyday life in the port and the names and symbols of the corporations can still be seen. There were also offices used by ship-owners and their agents from places as far apart as Tunisia and the south of France, Sardinia and Egypt. In one office, belonging to a merchant from the town of Sabratha in North Africa, there is a delightful mosaic of an elephant.</p><p>The main cargo coming into Rome was grain from Africa. Much of this was distributed free to prevent social unrest. Although only men received this <em>annona</em> or corn dole, at times over 300,000 were eligible. In the centre of the square was a temple, probably dedicated to Ceres, goddess of the harvest. Among the buildings excavated are many large warehouses in which grain was stored before it was shipped on to Rome.</p><p>The Decumanus leads to the Forum and the city&rsquo;s principal temple, erected by Hadrian in the 2nd century AD and dedicated to Jove, Juno and Minerva. In this rather romantic, lonely spot, it is hard to imagine the Forum as a bustling centre, where justice was dispensed and officials met to discuss the city&rsquo;s affairs. In the 18th century it was used as a sheepfold.</p><p>Away from the main street are the buildings where Ostia&rsquo;s inhabitants lived. The great majority were housed in rented apartments in blocks three or four storeys high known as <em>insulae</em>. These varied considerably in their comfort and decoration. The House of Diana was one of the smarter ones, with a balcony around the second floor, a private bathhouse and a central courtyard with a cistern where tenants came to collect their water. Around the ground floor of the block were shops, taverns and bars selling snacks and drinks. In the bar at the House of Diana you can see the marble counter used by customers buying their sausages and hot wine sweetened with honey. For the wealthy there were detached houses <em>(domus)</em> such as the House of the Dioscuri, which has fine mosaics, and the House of Cupid and Psyche, named after a statue there. This is now in the site&rsquo;s Museo Ostiense, near the Forum, along with other sculptures and reliefs found in Ostia. Among the houses and shops there are other fascinating buildings including a laundry and the firemen&rsquo;s barracks.</p><p>The religions practised in Ostia reflect the cosmopolitan nature of the port. There are also no fewer than 18 temples dedicated to the Persian god Mithras, as well as a Jewish synagogue dating from the 1st century AD and a Christian basilica. A plaque records the death of St Augustine&rsquo;s mother in a hotel here in AD 387.</p>",,Viale dei Romagnoli 717,Rome,00119,Further Afield,,Italy,06 5635 0215,,,,,,,,,,,,www.ostiaantica.beniculturali.it/en,Ostia Antica,,,"04, 011, 018, C4, C13, C19",<p>Nov–mid-Feb: 8:30am–4:30pm Tue–Sun; mid-Feb–mid-Mar: 8:30am–5pm Tue–Sun<p></p>mid-Mar: 8:30am–5:30pm Tue–Sun; Apr–Aug: 8:30am–7:15pm Tue–Sun</p><p>Sep: 8:30am–7pm Tue–Sun; Oct: 8:30am–6:30pm Tue–Sun (last admission 1 hour before closing)</p>,,"Mon, 1 Jan, 25 Dec",,,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,,Book in advance at www.ostiaantica.beniculturali.it/en/prenotazioni.php,,8,4,4,,,EUR,41.757704,12.299941,TRUE,,FALSE,FALSE,"Ancient Ruins, Historic Sights and Landmarks",famous-landmarks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hadrian’s Villa
